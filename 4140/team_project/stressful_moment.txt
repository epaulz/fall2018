When I wasn't understanding something for my one of my exams.
Every afternoon after classes when i sit down to see what work I have to do
I had to lead a discussion in one of my class classes so I was stressed prior and during that class bc I had to familiarize myself with the content 
Physics Class
When i was the only one from my lab group who showed up to do the lab
Bombed the exam 
I had to demo a project for a class and I was stressed.
I was late to my Chemistry Lab because my alarm did not go off
I felt stressed when I had an exam in less than 2 hours and I could not understand a section, which is going to be on the exam. 
Now 
Medications Math Exam
My test
During physics 2 lab. We had to do the pre-lab quiz, the entire lab, and the lab report with post lab questions in 3 hours.

Studying for my quiz today
Before my exam
When I almost forgot to submit my lab report on time.

I stayed up all night doing a project for my senior design class and got zero sleep.
I was stressed out when my lab partner and I realized that we donâ€™t have enough time to complete lab.

Doing homework and looking at my incredibly full calendar
When I had to walk to class and be on time for the iclicker check that happens at the beginning 
More assignments kept piling on as I went through my classes
