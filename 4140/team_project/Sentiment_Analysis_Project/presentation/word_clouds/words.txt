My steering wheel overheats and I have to turn it off after about a minute of use.
Doesnt always recognize phone book command
Drivers seat only did not work. Button kept turning off. Dealer replaced seat and works fine now.
Noise is sporadic

: I can't get the tailgate to open by using my foot
Told me today that navigation was down.  Really wanted to get to my destination. Finally called the person I was going to visit and she guided me by phone!
System defaults to Oklahoma and I live in Indiana









Expected digital speed and posted speed limits to be included as standard feature given the price of the X-3 : Expected a digital display of speed and posted speed: See comment above about lack of Digital Speed and Posted Speed Limit display
I may learn how to better operate with practice. Owners Manual showed more adjustments as compared to our X3. May have over simplified.
Owners Manual had more adjustmens as compared to our X-3

About half the time; the system does not recognize the command


When driving you can hear outside noise; when on the freeway; you cannot hear the radio unless it is turned up. The noise seems to be coming from a gap within the doors.
When driving you can hear outside noise.  When driving on the freeway; the noise is loud enough that it drowns out the radio.
When driving there are times when the reception will fade out; when going through a tunnel or under a bridge there is static with AM stations.
The off button and the knob to adjust the temperature seems to do dual functions. If I turn the temperature up; it activates the air.


: Car refused to start. After it started; navigation system had changed display. After car was turned off and restarted a few minutes later; everything returned to the previous display.



Would be better if it was just a space and didn't hold cup tightly
: Car refused to start. After it started; navigation system had changed display. After car was turned off and restarted a few minutes later; everything returned to the previous display.
turn signal needs a stronger tactile feel to its operation. Often in trying to return signal lever to neutral position; overshoot an signal a turn in opposite direction. In correcting overshoot; overshoot in the opposite direction. This results in first signaling a lane change in one direction; then in oposite direction and back and forth. This is a real safety issue. I hate this function.
little value in knowing the engine oil temp; would like to know engine coolant temp instead
hidden behind rim of steering wheel
on cold start; blows cold air; does not wait until there is sufficient heat from engine. In addition; auto temp setting does not result in proper air temperature matching setting. Very poor control of interior temp; either very hot  or very cold; overcast winter day. This is a design problem; Dealer will be a waste of time.
This is a design problem. Fan speed is high to compensate for insufficiently sized air ducting.

Controls do not control temperature well within cabin.
does not clear ice from exterior of windshield; interior fogs in area of ice. not enough heat available to keep windshield clear of snow even when starting from heated garage. this is a design issue.
Had a bad sensor plug on a side airbag in the passenger door that resulted in an airbag failure message. Was intermittent. Took to dealership two times. Once to diagnose and once to replace sensor plug which resulted in everything working properly
I will mention call 'person's name' that is in my phone contact and it will respond with say the number; this happens ocassionally. Navigation is worse; generally doesn't understand an address.



Difficult to see the head up display when using polarized sunglassess
temperature of the heated steering wheel is variable; I cannot manually adjust.  Also gets too hot where the bottom center spoke meets the wheel - can almost ccause a burn there where there is metal.
inputting address sometimes does not work
control for one of the seats came out of mount - cannot be used until repaired.   it is mounted low and suseptible to being kicked or hit my items on the floor.
difficult to use seat belt with booster seat due to the latch for the seatbelt being recessed.
occasional locking when trying to buckle
the switch for the rear heated seat came out of its mount and not accessable
in some cases the engine will shut down too fast; like at a very brief stop sign.  can also be abrupt like when there is a more forceful stop.
not very effective in hard rain




The navigation system doesn't recognize addresses and is 100% annoying to use.  I end up using google maps & my iphone.







I mentioned it to salesperson during test drive at speeds of 40-50mph.  He said it was improved - I said it wasn't because I had a 2011 X3
I think it is poor insulation under the car or noisy tires.
I Xenon light on my Lexus




Even the BMW person from the dealership cold not find it!


There was a chip on the exterior paint; front; passenger side near headlamp noticed  upon delivery. A certified dealer touch-up professional 'patched/repaired' the spot.
: RIGHT FRONT HEADLIGHT NOT WORKING UPON DELIVERY
NAV SYSTEM DI NOT ACCURATELLY DEPICT MY CURRENT LOCATION DUE TO LOOSE SOLDER CONNECTION IN SHARK FIN ROOD ANTENNA : NAVIGATION MAP DID NOT SHOW MY CORRECT LOCATION DUE TO LOOSE SOLDER CONNECTION IN SHARK FIN ANTENNA
I have tried to connect my new iPhone 6 to my BMW X3; but I haven't been able to do so.
I have another car  and when I set the temperature I can immediately feel the heat.  With the X3; it takes time and it doesn't really feel as hot as it should be.

You can barely put anything in the glove compartment.
I haven't taken the time to view the manual; but am unable to revise orientation to North direction for map. Find system is not intuitive.

Snow packs in wheels and makes car shimmer
High beam is not automatic/sensor.  My other car is and cost less
Hidden behind wheel
Cannot see control

Hard to see


Impossible to see and use. Very annoying
Not sure how auto works for heat. Always big fan speed

System was confusing - not clear how to initiate operation or turn it off; if desired.  Would like to switch between 360 view and rear camera.  Not clear how to do that.
The user interface is poorly designed.  It is not intuitive. : User interface is not intuitive.  It is difficult to navigate the menus and to find the functions.

: I cannot get the tailgate to open every time with the underneath 'kick' motion.  Perhaps it is operator error!
The first time I tried to use the rear window defroster ; it did not defrost the whole window- just the area within the wiper blade.
I understand that it is no longer mechanical but computer controlled .Hence ; it is very responsive to very little pressure -First noticed it on Highway after picked up from dealership for initial drive . Buyers need to be told this .

The dial is a joke . A touchscreen like my Ford would be superior . Tried to use Navigation with voice commands -didn't work .Can't get/maintain favorites on Sirius . No amount of training in the BMW dealership could prepare you for this . I don't have time to spend hours reading the manual -Need to get rid of the dial !




This feature was briefly mentioned when car picked . Startled both my wife and I when it first happened . I thought the car stalled . If this feature is getting us significant extra mileage it should be eliminated . Or better explained how to turn it off !!!!




Makes a noise that sounds as though it is catching or needs to be lubed
They need to be adjusted & I have had difficulty finding the right instructions in the manual
Button and light are both on the side of the steering column behind the wheel. Hard to find the button and hard to tell if it's on or not.
The interior trim scratches easily to cleaning rags.
Cup holders are too small.
The hood of the car is shaped in such a way that in the morning; with normal overnight moisture; the hood creates two rivers of water that splash up the windshield as you drive; interfering with vision.  This continues until the hood finally dries.  Very annoying!
It is difficult to see the icons on the washer/wiper handle.  Also; the wiper has intermittent dial; which does not change the speed at all.  Essentially there is one wiper speed; fast.  The only alternative is to manually hit the handle when a quick wipe is needed.
We have set the #1 and #2 multiple times; but pushing the button does not do anything.  The seat stays put unless manually pushing each electronic slide button.
Same as previous page
Within days of receiving the new car; the drivers seat has blue shading where the driver slides in and out of the car.  The side of the seat is slightly elevated higher than the main area of the seat.  In order to get in and out of the car there is excessive pressure on the raised area of the seat; which leaves blue from denim clothing and a crushed look to that part of the seat.
Two different ways to set the temp; neither seems to work on its own.  Very confusing.  Have to play around with it and constantly change it up and down. : There is a digital heat dial; to set temp by degrees.  There is also a round wheel with a blue square on one side; and a red square on the other side.  No idea how these two relate.  I have figured that I can set a temp number; and then use the little wheel to increase or decrease from the set temp.  If I only use the digital sets; there is no temp change at all.  Also; there are too many set stops on the fan direction; and it is difficult to locate the feet or straight blow.
If I turn the fan on past the 2nd little triangle; it gets louder and louder as you go to full speed.  It drowns out the stereo and conversation.
The defroster takes a very long time to clear the front window.  It is as though the fan is not pointed at the correct angle to clear the driver's side.  I have to blow it at full speed and toggle back and forth between hot air and cold air.
Center console has a built in cell phone charger/holder.  It takes up almost all of the space within the console; leaving little/awkward room for anything else.  Cannot figure out how to take the cell phone holder out.  It is not something I would ever use.  Not very useful.
Glove compartment and surround; interior doors in foot area.  It seems wherever someones feet can touch gets scuffed very easily.  The scuffs do not clean off with warm water and mild soap.
I expected brighter head light to this 2015 brand new X3. The brightness is same as the one in 2005 Honda Odyssey. No technical development in lightings during 10 years? I'm not sure if I choose the LED LIGHT PACKAGE option; it would be much brighter but BMW can do better job in lighings for the cars with standard options.
It just doesn't get it. Very poorly made. Why did BMW make this fuction nobody can use?
When it paired with the phone; the sound quality is very poor so I cannot listen to the music that I saved in my phone. The sound is very samll and static just like the sound from very old stereo in antique shop. One day; when I start the engine; the bluetooth paired with my phone automatically and the sound was like thundering I almost shocked to death. Overall; I don't like BMW's bluetooth technology.
There were white dusty fingerprints inside of the panel glass
No matter how much I try; I can't get the motion of my foot to make it open 
Washer fluid level low warning lights kept coming on.  Told dealer who dismissed me as stupid female that doesn't know her nozzles are frozen.  Wasn't due to cold and knew that so when it was 60 degrees; I took a pic of the dash warnings to show the BMW idiots it is a bad sensor. : Already noted - washer fluid warnings but is really faulty sensor
The widget clock only works part of the time .
Washer fluid low warnings.  Bad sensor as fluid container is full.
The dash lights are very distracting so I do not use this feature at all.
Sometimes it doesn't get hot or stay hot; and other times it is burning hot and have to turn it off immediately.  Should be like controls for the seats with consistent temps and levels the driver can adjust.  Also; the button is in the worst spot.  Put it on the dash like everything else!

Voice recognition rarely understands what I am saying.  Alternative route hard to find; need easier access to detour options.  Also the turn by turn route list is buried and can't be found most times.  I want to know the turns or route I will be taking.
open / close icon seems opposite of normal what is open verses closed vents.
The small compartment on the driver's side dash between the steering wheel and door doesn't often close.  It has to be just right to latch or stay latched.

: Front drivers window squeaks when lowering.  I plan on letting the dealer review when I take the vehicle in for the first service
Even slowly and clearly speaking it does not get the correct name all the time.  It happens more with this vehicle than my 4runner or jeep
The BMW online widgets that gives me weather updates for where I am  does not work lately.  it is on and off often.

seems to be a low RPM phenomenon  at almost any speed.  Not that excessive but noticeable.  At other speeds just fine and doesn't impact steering whatsoever.  May be tied to the fact that the vehicle has lane departure warning .  Not a major issue.



Does not always understand voice input for destination address

I just can't seem to put the seat belt on easily. I am 5ft 2inches in height. I have to turn around and look at the buckle before I can lock it.
Whenever I use the windshield wiper fluid to wipe the windshield; I get a very strong chemical odor inside the car. Lasts for several minutes.
In a low light hard to get to location in the glove box. This is not a dealer problem- its a design flaw.


Roads that are not available as the suggested route. BMW uses the least expensive mapping company and has the worst software
It used to work but just stopped working


: I face visibility issues while driving; especially while shifting lanes the beams on right side obstruct view while changing lanes which results in a larger blind spot. It is very difficult to know if a car is approaching from behind in the adjacent lane.. The lane guidance system shd be standard in X3 I had called the dealership to get the system installed and they declined as the system can only be fitted during manufacturing process which is not good
this only was present when I picked up the car - it has not been present since then; but the car is almost always garaged
the real problem here is that they are not very useful - they fail to warn when someone is in your blind spot; which is the reason for the system. I have this in other BMW's and it works much better
frequently the system does not recognize the phone - need to repair - this does not happen in my older BMW's; but it did in the 2014 BMW that I traded for this car - new software not compatable?
Requires you to state the street name; city; state and zip code . Sometimes confuses the order of these.
Storage bin is just one large box. Could use a shelf.
The button to set the parking brake doesn't make sense
The floormats that came with the car are fine.  I was given winter mats for the front floors; and these do not fit.  They are too large for the space.
The seal has been sticking so it aborts the opening process and self closes. I have to manually tug on it while pressing the button to break the seal.
I can get it to activate about 10% of the time.

It sounds like wind is coming in the vehicle when it's not.
It's hidden so that I have to pull a yoga move to be able to contort my head to see if the heated steering wheel indicator is lit or not.

The plastic door trim doesn't survive kids with muddy or dirty shoes which scuff and mark them.
DOES NOT ALERT YOU OF UPCOMING TURNS ETC. TELLS YOU WHERE TO GO WHEN ITS TOO LATE SO YOU END UP MISSING THE TURN
TAKES TOO LONG TO HEAT UP

External foot motion detector is difficult to consistently operate successfully.

Not at all user friendly.  Sequence of steps in entering information is difficult to understand and not intuitive.  This navigation system is inferior to my iPhone navigation map; which I typically resort to using because it is so much easier to operate and provides excellent map guidance. : Navigation system
Requires manual operation of Driver 1 or Driver 2 buttons; rather than automatically adjusting depending on which key is being carried by the driver. I have been told that there is a way to make it work automatically; but the BMW Genius at the dealership is the only person in the dealership who knows how to program the system to work as I want and expect it to work.
Hard to see heated seat control. Steering wheel is in the way.
Too close to dashboard
: Lower Left Running Light not completely tight.  Inside left door the Styrofoam not completely flush so sometimes when you open the door you get a sweak.
Lower Left Running Light not completely tight.  Inside left door the Styrofoam not completely flush so sometimes when you open the door you get a sweak.
Used to brakes that you don't have to apply excessive pressure. My Mercedes brakes are better then the BMW.
Very easy to forget to use as so used to manual brake. Wish that the Parking Brake would automatically engage when you put autotransmission into Park and release when put into Gear
Not enough upward and downward travel.  Should be electric and not manual
Dealer noted and order the wood panel for passenger door and center console.  There were defects in the lamination
just that it shows on the wheels and have to clean frequently
cannot see he indicator light without taking eyes off the road and bending head in a funny angle around the steering wheel
hard to figure out which key the seat programmed to or which one it will recognize when we get in the car
: Automatic mode does not keep window from fogging up -- have to switch to defrost mode and the fan gets too noisy
: Automatic mode does not keep window from fogging up -- have to switch to defrost mode and the fan gets too noisy


: The front hood release is hard to find.
The distinction between turning the signal on temporarily  and permanently  is difficult to gauge.  I find that I often turn on one kind of signal when I intend to use the other.
I thought the 'adaptive' part would be optional; i.e. you could use it as a conventional cruise control on highways that have cars passing you  thereby triggering the distance feature.  That is not the case.  You have to use the adaptive aspect whether you want to or not.  I will have to take it out on an interstate that isn't too busy and learn how to use the damn thing.  I know many people who never use their cruise controls because the 'adaptive' nature causes you to slow down / speed up / slow down.  I asked the dealer and he said he doesn't use his either!
Measured MPG is significantly less than advertized MPG.
It requires strict command and it doesn't interpret address well. It would be nice to say 'find nearest Starbucks'
Two times during start-up of engine; I partially depressed the accelerator. Not a series problem since the car was not in gear; and I immediately noticed the high RPMs.  Ilearned quickly to avoid the situation.

It is awkwardly placed so you can not just reach over and pop it open; I have to sit up and turn to reach it.   And then it opens too far and it is very hard to reach to close if you are driving.
: not really a problem; but the doors are so heavy that they do not always stay open and slam shut on thier own.  I was getting into my car and the door slammed shut onto my knee and left a huge bruise that I have had for weeks.  I'm very concerned about my young son getting his little arms or legs closed in a door if it slams shut like that!

some stations go silent for a few seconds and then come back on.
Exterior door handle light on front passenger door is a different color from the other three doors. Waiting on the dealer ordered part.
Front passenger door had a damaged or defective speaker; sound was horrible. Dealer replaced.
I have had other cars with voice recognition that performed better; with BMW it seems to be hit or miss if the voice recognition will work.
: Headlights were not calibrated to follow as you turned corners
delay in registering position causes confusion : parking brake system is not user friendly: has a delayed reaction so that i can never remember which way you do it; doesn't have a good 'feel'
Annoying amount of layers to get information; doesn't remember addresses to necessitation retyping in same thing over and over
The electronic hatch opener will stop half way at times.
took some time to figure out how to get the system to work correctly.  No clear notice on rear wiper as to which way to turn to wash; which way to turn to just use the wipers
instructions on how to change the view difficult to use.  The warnings are not always clear
Open spot left side of drivers seat where the carpet pieces don't come together correctly.  Can see through to the floorboard.
The ones that are there except for the center are not big enough for a sunglass case.  The center one is under your arm; so it is not easily accessable when driving
Tends to have a real lag when starting from a stop in the morning.  Tends to lag and then go. m


wind noise should be not exisitant
will not hold memory
It just emits a squeak right before reaching maximum opening. I haven't tried any spray lube; yet. Not a big deal.
With my wide foot/shoes; there have been a few occasions where; when I had to hit the brake hard; the right part of my shoe contacted the accelerator pedal.
The rear doors do not unlock when the vehicle is shut down.  I MAY be missing programming the feature myself OR it has to be 'coded' at the dealer.  I keep forgetting to hit the unlock button before exiting the vehicle and when I try to open the rear door; have to go back to that or hit the remote unlock.
: 'Driveline Malfunction' warning appeared in display after vehicle had sat outside in temps <10 degrees for four days. The vehicle was operable but at reduced power.  I drove it for ten minutes; shut down; re-started and it has been normal ever since.


: The automatic hatch opener where you wave your foot under doesn't work too well
Can't see the light when you turn it on
Works for my husband's leg but not for my leg
Works for my husband's leg but not my leg
Difficult to reach control while driving and looking ahead
Doors work but having to pull the handle twice to get out is different than any other vehicle I've owned.  It would be nice if you could change this to single pull.
Followed the instructions on how to put wipers in a position to fold out to keep them from freezing on the windshield but they didn't move as expected.  This was done at the dealership with two salesmen.  Haven't gone back to talk to a person from the service department yet.
: Not really a problem but the automatic flow control/display is very different from our Toyota.  You get no feedback on how the air flow is directed; just that it is in automatic mode.
Motion detect for tail gate usually doesn't work. When it does the tailgate only goes up part way

waving your foot under the car is supposed to open the hatch.  no luck
the presence of key not recognize either for door unlock or ignition in many instances
the system makes noise all the time particularly when there is snow and ice.  Inferior to the Subaru system we had on our Forester
cannot figure it out and it is no
the visual and the sound transmitted through the steering wheel don't mesh well
have no figured out how to use it
gets verbal phrasing wrong most of the time

cannot figure out how to make sure the recirculation feature is on.  the options are automatic and manual.  what about just putting on circulator?
2 problems...first; in order to shut the ignition; you need to press the control twice. If you press once; it feels like the car is off. Once when we first drove it   we parked the car in an inside garage and thought it was off; left it; and came back an hour later and it was on and running. This should not happen and there was no warning sound to tell us this.  Second problem is more significant. We park the car in a service garage; and one of the keys is left with the attendants. We called for the car one day; and when we got there it was running and waiting to drive. My husband drove it about 50 miles to do an errand. He parked the car and shut it off. He then realized he did not have HIS key on him. The attendant who started the car had the key. The car did not give any signal that a key was not in the car after my husband drove off with it. I believe it is supposed to do that and not function beyond a certain distance if there is no key detectable.
We have not tried to use the feature yet as it seems too overwhelming to try. Had hoped it would be explained and/or be obvious how to use it.
IN general the navigation system is good; but at times it doesn't recognize an address and worst of all; it often gives convoluted routes and has given us toll roads to save less than a minutes time. I also do not know how to adjust the system to get a different style of routing; or to see other options for routing available.   As for audio the speakers seem very low volume and not great quality


When doors are set to lock automatically when underway and then driver stops and exits vehicle; the rear doors cannot be made to unlock automatically
In general too complicated. Takes multiple steps.
May not be deemed 'excessive' but not as good as advertised. I do not use Eco though. In this regard; the fuel tank capacity is smaller than expected; therefore with the consumption issue; we're always filling up.
The display panel is too small! The numbers on the speedometer and tachometer are small.  So are the computer data display.  It takes an effort trying to understand the message or data due to the small character size.
: Unable to import from MP3 Player to vehicle computer. Difficulty playing from MP3 player
Dealer ordered new part and it has not come in yet.
I find it very hard to find a position that is comfortable for using both the gas and brake pedals.
Passenger side door squeaks when fully opened. Does not squeak on closing.
I have had one problem with the system accuracy. After taking a wrong turn; the system's attempt to correct led me down a dead end street.
This isn't really a problem; just my personal preference.  My last car's breaks were more responsive.  These you have to exert more pressure.  Maybe I'll get use to it in time.
Very small digital display.  Must have been designed by someone young.
Control is rather hidden.  Once you know where it is you can find it by 'feel' but not ideal.
Noise is present sometimes.  Can't figure out if it is the seatbelt rattling; something in the trunk; or the door.  Not a big noise though.
Rather small diameter_ÔøΩÔøΩ
door swings so wide; the door can't be closed from a seated position; you have to lean way out and grab the bottom of the storage bin : getting into the car; the door opens so wide that the handle to close the door cant be reached..i have to lean out to grab the bottom on the storage bin on the door
too close together
waaaayyyy tooo many steps to get to the final menu
too small; poorly organized
storage on driver side;lower left of steering column-odd placement
I had a warning light tell me that there is a rear lamp malfunction.  I need to take it to the dealer for service.
Very tiny chip and several light scratches

dash; drivers side panel and front window had a large gap and ragged material at small location


Automatic engine shut down/restart disengages while break is still being held sometimes.
MPG of city driving is slightly less than advertised.

BMW DESIGN ISSUE;PROGRAMMING IS CUMBERSOME
BMW DESIGN ISSUE;SOME PROGRAMMING IS CUMBERSOME.
GAP BETWEEN DOOR  AND SEAT CONTROLS IS TIGHT TO OPERATE THEM EASILY. IT IS NOT SOMETHING THE DEALER CAN DO; BMW SHOULD REDESIGN THEM; PERHAPS TO LOCATE THEM ON THE DRIVERS DOOR AS ON MANY OTHER CARS.
Metal is not even with plastic.
Paint dried in a clump



Rear hatch door intermittently fails to open.  Has been in for service - no problem founf

Display does not have option to move it sideways.  I have to change my seating position in order to view the display.


When placing containers in the the cup holder I constantly catch the cup lip; prying open the container.
The radio reception is spotty. The reception goes in and out in areas our other vehicles have full radio reception. The areas we have experienced this is urban as well as suburban locations.
The presets associated with the keys are very confusing and don't seem to make any sense.  One minutes we think we've got it all worked out and the next its clear we have no idea.
I can't see the control because it's hidden by the steering wheel.
Emergency call function occasionally causes an error message
Steam rises from engine compartment when driving in rain

I think that this quality of vehicle should have a better; easier to use tilt/telescopic steering wheel adjustment.  Probably a power tilt and telescopic feature would be better and easier to use rather than a manual one.  The manual control is not in a very easy to see position for me. I'd expect to find this manual adjustment on a base model of a low budget car.
Would like for the auto sensing function of the front wipers to be automatic unless turned off.  Not like they are where you have to push in the end of the wiper stick to activate the auto sensing function.
Backup camera should be able to zoom in.  When looking at the camera; it appears that the approaching car is farther away; but in actuality; it is right behind your car.  Couldn't find a way to adjust this.
This is the most disappointing feature of my new car.  After driving an Acura MDX with blind spot monitoring; it is far superior than the BMW.  The design engineers should follow the Acura's design.  With the BMW's blind spot indicator on the side mirrors; it is too light to see esp. in bright sunlight or when it is raining. Would be better on the inside of the door like the Acura.  Also it should be on whenever a car is by your side .  Not just when a car is approaching from behind in the blind spot.  Again; this feature was a disappointment.
Another disappointment with the BMW safety features.  The Acura MDX lane departure warning system seems to be superior.  Don't understand why you have to be going 40 mph before the departure warning is working.  Also; I like the Acura's warning beep instead of the BMW's vibrating steering wheel.  A warning beep is more effective.  When I was driving on a bumpy road and departed the lane; I barely could feel the steering wheel vibrating. Also; don't like having to look for little arrows to see if the lane departure system is working for both sides of the road.
I've had the collision warning indicator go on a couple of times when there wasn't any collision about to occur.  I have a slightly steep driveway and when exiting; it will alarm that a collision is ahead.  Also; during the early a.m. hour with sunrise; the warning stated that the collision system wasn't working.  .
The gearshift isn't hard to operate; it is unusual to shift forward for reverse and have to push the button on top to put the car in park.  I have to instruct other drivers of my car how to put the car in park.  Don't understand the design of this. I'm getting accustomed to this; but fear that I'll think I've put the car in park when actuality I've put it in reverse out of habit.
It does work fine but this winter when it was cold outside the back hatch wouldn't open with the 'soccer kick' motion. After several attempts we opened it manually and the rubber gasket seemed to be stuck together; perhaps due to the cold temp. we live in NC so it wasn't that cold! We haven't had the problem since then.
I enter addresses manually because the voice recognition system really does not function well.  The telephone system works very well; but not the navigation
The mat slides over the gas pedal which is a safety hazard.
: the rear speakers are too soft; and due to the location ; you do not get any surround sound effect at all.
sensor on the left front of the car somehow came loose and fell back into the whole. So; driving was loud and difficult. I didn't realize it was loose. Surely from factory and only washed at dealership. That is what the service rep decided must have happened.
the hatch is suppose to open with kicking of the foot when the key is in or on person.  Doesn't open  7 out of 10 times.  Have not had a chance to take in to ask dealership about it yet.

When air is off and outside air comes thru the vents there is a slight but annoying odor.
: The center console area scratches during normal use. Little scratches show up that are of great dismay as I like to keep my vehicle perfect.
Two phones were connected to Bluetooth when we picked up the car. When one of the phones does not connect; it is difficult to trouble shoot to get the phone connected. When I access the telephone app; it shows that both phones are programed.
The automatic open using your feet. Very inconsistent; hard to locate exact area to wave foot/leg under the vehicle.

Wind noise around seal of window; primarily driver side front

The same day of delivery I noticed the engine light on...brought it back and they said there was a problem with the gas gauge...it was fixed within a few days...three months later the engine light was on again ; this time the problem was a loose gas cap...was fixed the same day.
When the car in front of mine stops suddenly; I braked it hard too. The car would not stop; but shudder and make noises. After the first time; I went to the dealer; and they said the brake is ok. It happened again recently when I did a sudden braking.
new material smell; still trying to dispel it by opening the dorr parking everyday
I don't like this feature; so  I turned it off after reading the manual
The keyless entry for the rear door does not function.  It worked for the salesman at pick up and one time subsequently.  Otherwise no.  Further; the tailgate function on the key does not open the door either.  We have to use the button on the drivers side door to get the tailgate to open. : The handless entry for the tail door dos not and the remote also does not open the tail door.
The drivers side heated seat does not get warm enough and I believe that it also loses it's heating capacity over the course of the ride.
Heated steering wheel button is on steering column not visible while driving.
Center console had a scratch on delivery.
The front seats are not comfortable for a luxury vehicle...feel as though the cushion is short
Would prefer regular parking brake control; not just a small button

Haven't tried yet - afraid to try

: There is a random chirping sound emanating from the front left of the vehicle when driven.  It does not happen predictably; so when it does occur; the sound is quite audible and a bit disturbing; because its source is unknown.
I still haven't figured out to turn on the fog lights.  The location of these controls is not user friendly.
The clock display above the steering wheel is too small and it is difficult to set.
I still have not been able to figure out how to zero out the trip computer.
It is not clear to me what the yellow squares mean that appear on the display when I am backing up.
When I stop the vehicle; the AC air flow reduces as does its temperature
The glove compartment and interior door panels easily scuff when touched by a rider's shoes; even tennis shoes.  The dirt shows readily when touched by someone's shoes or fingers.
sometimes when I put the car in park the engine completely shuts down when i try to put it in drive

The heating steering wheel button has an orange LED that you cannot see while driving the car.  There should be an indicator on the dashboard.
: The check engine light came on.  Apparently a hose clamp came loose since it was not properly installed by the factory.  The problem was promptly addressed.
Need to navigate to deep menus to read the status of tire pressure.
I have never located the control for the headlight control system.
: We were unable to regain entry to the car after vacating for a few minutes in Key Largo; FL.  We called the BMW genius and he guided us by phone to a successful entry and ability to start the engine.  At that point we had about 2800 miles on the car and that particular problem has never re-occurred.  His directions stated to remove the 'key' from the fob to open the door and then to hold the fob against the right side of the steering column to start.  It worked.
My wife and I are both in our 80s and are not as accommodated by the high tech electronics that this car contains.  We realize BMWs need to include these options and will do our best to improve our usage of those that we asked to be included.  We recently returned from a FEB-MAR vacation and will make arrangements to meet with the dealer rep. at an early date for assistance.
The drivers side door made a large cracking nose one day upon opening. It does not appear to reoccur however the magnitude of the noise led me to believe something is not right.
The unlock feature of the front door does not always release all of the doors of the car. It is often necessary to unlock the passenger door once in the car.
The audio; navigation systems see to have so many features it is overwhelming and too complex/complicated. Offering three mechanisms; mouse function; writing function and menu function seems overly complicated and adds limited value. Just too many features and more complication than I find helpful or necessary. I have been driving the car for 3 months and am still overwhelmed by all of the complication making the experience unenjoyable.
End Navigation command sometimes is misunderstood. As well as other verbal commands. Don't find this feature useful because of this.
The overall experience is unnecessarily complex ; too complex for my liking. So many choices; face north; south; east; west; zoom in/out; fast route; details/no details; not sure how to use the detour functions/options; not always sure about the route with the red and white lines on screen display. Doesn't feel like there is an option missing however at the same time it just feels like there are too many options and it is overall more complex that it needs to be. Do users really need ALL the features choices when you weigh that against complexity and time to adopt and understand and be comfortable with the car. I don't feel it is a positive not to be able to master all of my vehicles features.
Glove box can not even accommodate the users manual! NEver mind all of the incidental materials BMW has mailed post sale. There is no place to store all of this material in the car making it releatively useless
Cup holders too small to accommodate some mugs.
The floor mat needs to be adjusted daily or it obstructs clear use of the gas pedal. Feels like it was designed too large.
THe engine shut down feature is not attractive and is disruptive. When the car starts back up the delay is unnerving. would like to understand the value of the shutdown feature versus the imposed delay and disruption that it introduces. Hard to get used to. not smooth or transparent when it restarts.
Changing the mechanism for how to put the car in gear feels unnecessary and confusing. Pressing a button to put the car in Park and pushing forward and back is not intuitive. I have put the car in drive accidentally and almost hit a car in front of me because of these new features and operating processes.
Sometimes it will not click into place when closing. It seems that you have to close the door very slowly.
I am not sure if it is the gas peddle that is the problem or the rubber mat  that I purchased. When I where a shoe with a heal; my leg  hits the bottom of the dash board. Sometimes I feel my heal could get stuck between the mat and the peddle. When I am wearing flat shoes I do not get that feeling. I will tell you that I am 5'11 in hight with long legs.
I would like to see a feautre similar to what I had on my last car  that when you tap the turn signal it blinks three times and then automatically shuts off. I have to fiddle with the turn signal too much to get it to turn off after changeing lanes and often time I fiddle too much and I inadvertently turn the blinker on in the opposite direction.
I probably did not answer the question properly but my issue is not with the window controls it is with the front passanger window itself. It makes a harsh squeeking noise when I lower it.
The steering wheel; the way I like it positioned  hides the milage odometer. I have to lean forward to see it
It is the BMW rubber mats option that I purchased. The material feels too hard; and I already mentioned the issues about the mat beting too close to the gas peddle
back-up camera gets dirty when driving in messy weather making it hard to use.  Perhaps in the future there could be a way to shield it or clean it from driver controls?
i am a pretty technical savvy person; but I have had a really difficult time figuring out the nav system.  I usually give up and use my phone.
Gas and Brake Pedals to close
I am a short woman; 5'2' and the lumbar adjustment digs into my back because it's to high and HARD.  At times I feel like taking a knife and cutting it to shreds - very uncomfortable; especially on a trip of over 1 hour duration
A/C takes an abnormally time to cool vehicle - even with 'max' button used.
Glove Box is excessively small
Center console storage is way to small and insufficient

Seem to be of a light; easily broken material..and items can be difficult to insert/extract

It took me a while to understand the control to operate - I was either push it to right or left and was difficult to understand the 'resistance point'. AND I HAVE TO SAY THE BMW MANUAL IS 'THE WORST' MANUAL WRITTEN IN POOR ENGLISH AND POOR EXPLANATION!
Sitting right by the cup holders; it is very easy to spill liquid on them

It is stupid put the cup holders behind the stick and right by the power socket. Very very easy to spill the liquid on both. Extreme uncomfort; So much difficulty to take and put the mug back in the holder without hitting the stick - so much driving distraction. Plain stupidity.
Weatherstripping disconnected or torn
Noise coming from passenger side. Could be through windshield; vent area. Only when exceeding 50 mph
x
The iDrive is so 'overengineered' it is not intuitive at all. I understand not all features are for everyone; but it seems to me there are 50% more features than anyone needs and a large percentage of those you do need; are not frequently used. It takes away from the experience. Specificially; the interactive map...moving the map...should be easier to use.
It doesnt sync to the remote like the operators manaul says it should
x
I do not have this problem; but my husband with bigger feet have this issue.
The vents seem very small and can not be adjusted good enough towards small children on car seats.
There is a high pitch  noise coming from Vent outlets. This noise disappeared when the adjuster on the panel is moved all the way to red/hot. This noise is very annoying.
The 'BMW X3' plaque by the rear driver entrance came off within 1 month after delivery.
: Fuel guage was off. Had to be reset by the dealer
Should automatically find spots to park in but often times misses spots that are clearly large enough to fit in.  Hard to operate and engage.
seats
: Using your foot to open rear hatch does not work all the time.
Can't seem to set favorites.  Had them set and then disappeared
The routing system seems to take you a most indirect way to the waypoint
A/C doesn't seem to cool vehicle efficiently
No sound when play music using apps in iphone; bluetooth connected


automatic opener did not work and module had to be replaced
automatic tailgate stopped working and module had to be replaced

Took multiple attempts and a trip to dealer to learn that heads-up display position was specific to each drivers key fob. Manual was of no value in explaining how to set this up.
Intermittently; bluetooth clarity is very poor.
Seats should automatically return to pre-programmed position associated with the key fob present at the drivers door when opening. After repeated attempts to learn the programming procedure from the manual; the seat memory still did not work correctly. Returned the car to dealership where set-up experts improved the memory performance; but seats still do not reliably return to their memory positions.
: Rear cargo tray has only been used twice for light objects and small amounts of luggage but the tray is scuffed and the finish is marred and the marks to not go away with cleaning.
: This car has the 2.0 L 4-cyl turbocharged engine. I had the same engine in my previous 2012 328i. In the X3; the performance is good but economy is disappointing. Also; as with the 328i; the engine has a distracting clatter typical of 4-cylinder engines; but I would have thought BMW would have engineered this noise out by now.

Doesn't seem to understand when we state an address.
Not enough details soon enough presented on local streets
finding it on the display is not easy

Even with modifying position of HUD it still is not visible for me to see.

: It does not raise me high enough to see heads up display.
holders are size specific not variable.
Just discovered the broken release because I sat in the rear seat. So I have no idea if it was broken when I bought the car.

I have an Iphone 6 plus and it doesn't work with it
When I think of an automated HVAC system I set the temp to the desired temperature and the car does the rest.
Frequently the only way to get my iPhone to play music over Bluetooth is to switch to radio and back to media after phone has connected to the system. This issue is present in my X4; my friends X5 and 535i and affects the iPhone 5; iPhone 5s; iPhone 6 and iPhone 6Plus so I think it is an inherent issue with iPhone and the BMW ConnectedDrive system.
They're probably working properly; just don't feel like they have enough grip for a car of this ilk.
It pops once during each time in use.
Every time getting in or out of the car the seat squeeks.
: Excessive wind noise and whistling sounds.
Steering wheel makes a scraping/rubbing noise when turning.  Happens all the time.


while most controls on this car are intuitive; and EVENTUALLY; the radio controls  are 'complete' and even clever at times; it does require getting used to.   when my wife takes the car; I can count on her coming back frustrated and subsequently I have to 'undo' what she has done to my settings.   it is not a complaint; but it should be more intuitive.
the top speaker cover is misaligned on the top of the IP
on rough rd or bump you can hear a loud squeak coming from the driver side 
The car was delivered severely scratched on the entire front end  and quarter panels. One of the highest-rated detailers in the entire US  said it was some of the worst paint he has ever seen. There is a difference of over 1mm in paint on spots of the hood alone. It cost me over $3000 to have the paint corrected and BMW NA gave me a 'goodwill' of $1049 towards this. I have never seen a brand new car with so many scratches and blemishes. It was; and still is; appalling.
I am sometimes unable to answer calls that come in to the vehicle. A software update corrected this issue for now.
The system would sometimes shut down erratically and display in orange letters 'NO SIGNAL'. I had zero access to navigation; music; control displays; etc. at that point.
The stitching is very uneven and looks poorly done for a luxury vehicle. The inconsistencies in stitching throughout the vehicle are very evident and discouraging. : Scratches; mis-aligned stitching on my seats; and visible grease marks abound inside this brand new X4. Quality control was non-existent on this vehicle.
The glossy black panel around the headlamp switch was severely scratched and looked as if it were very; very abused. The piece was replaced with a new part from Germany  and was installed and scratched again!
The door creaks quite a bit when cold and will sometimes go away after the vehicle warms up.
The headliner does not match up with the B-pillar plastic causing rattles and cracking sounds which have been 'adjusted' but not fixed. Every day; the car makes cracking sounds because of the misalignment.
There were greasy handprints on both A-pillars; where you could literally see the outlines of fingers and someone's fingerprints  staining that area. The A-pillar covers were replaced and now look different than the original set.
The woodgrain center console was scratched so badly at delivery that the BMW NA offered to replace it for me. The dealership did not feel that would be a good idea as rattles could occur later. As such; I will live with a damaged center console for the duration of the time I have this vehicle.
Sometimes I have to click back and forth from radio to media a few times in order to get my phone to connect.
There was a loud popping noise at higher volumes; using radio or bluetooth phone calls
The tray for the BMW connect which holds a cell phone is not removable; and since the iPhone 6 does not have a corresponding accessary to make the tray usable it is simply in the way and taking up space.

There have been about three times when I attempted to adjust the passenger side seat and nothing would happen when I push the button. I am not sure why and it will even begin to work minutes later. This is not all the time. It has only happened those three times or so.

Cup holder is too far away; should be behind the gearshift instead of in front of it. Hard to reach.
It is just a poor design and different than most cars.
MY RIGHT TIRE BEGAN TO DEFLATE AFTER I PUT SNOW TIRES ON. THE DEALER COULD NOT FIND ANY HOLES OR DEFECTS WITHT HE TIRES. I PUT MY SUMMER TIRES BACK ON.  I ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WHERE THE CAR VIBRATES A LOT WITH THE SNOW TIRES ON AROUND 75 MPH. I TRIED TWO SETS OF SNOW TIRES AND THEY BOTH DID THE SAME THING.
needed new seals. Dealer took care of immediatly
This car has the same engine as my last BMW so I expected the same.  This one has a few hiccups.
Air noise worse than my 7 year old bmw 330
Prefer tighter steering.
Blackberry phone Bluetooth looses connection and reverts to pairing screen when turning corners or randomly
Call is not dropped but neither pRty can hear seems goes to on hold and a Bluetooth pairing screen appears in menu on car screen

speed settings with a rain sensor don't work properly 
: noise

dealer suggested to fix this gap during the first service
during the first gears
: The kick-activated tail gate does not open all the way when using the kick function. It opens only part way and then must be pushed the rest of the way open by hand - it is difficult to push open. This problem occurs intermittently. The tailgate is set to open all the way and functions properly when using the key fob; internal button; and the button on the tailgate.
: the hatch opens by accident while having key in my pocket. I cannot close the hatch with my key fab. I have to do it manually.
navigation misinterprets or don;t understand verbal commands or street names/numbers
it is ackward to locate on side of the seat due to being too close to closed door.
controls cannot be seen when seated and interfere with the door panel. setting the seat memory is ackward since the memory button is on the side of the seat.

controls take time to get used to and to understand how they work with all other functions
The X4 at highway speeds is noisy around the front windows.
I had a 2012 X5 35D and the difference between the brakes on that and on my new X4 are noticeably different.  I feel the X4 brakes are not powerful enough for the car.  The stopping distance is long and I sometimes feel like it's not going to stop in time. I read a review of the X4 and that was one of the CONS of the car.
: the bmw connected drive widget for digital clock and weather went out for a week; I called dealer; they experienced the same; it came back on and has now been out again for over 2 weeks.
seat is narrow; find myself adjusting because seat sides can feel uncomfortable; I am not a large guy.
looking from driver seat at glass above passenger seat; looking to the right noticed ripples in glass
the paint is removed from the edge of the hood closest to the windshield. The area lines up with the wiper blade arm.
: The BMW Connect system goes dark periodically. the screen stays dark and no audio; backup camera or nav works. You have to reboot the system by pushing in the power button and holding it for at least 30 seconds for it to reboot.
doesn't always disengage when switch first pushed
Diesn't seem to really work on dufferent temperatures. The driver and the passanger does not differentiate

: The 'foot wave' doesn't work correctly to open the lift gate
: Heat / A/C does not blow well on foot / floor setting.



self explanatory. it squeaks when you open and close the door.
: every once in a while when we push the ignition button the 2nd time to turn off the car; it doesn't turn off.  we have to do it again.
Phonebook option - does not recognize what name I am saying
: I am a small person and the seat does not go up as high as I need it to.
Attaching cargo net is not intuitive.
Floor mats get dirty quickly.
Placing a finger/thumb on the top of door handle is supposed to lock the doors. Usually; I have to either rub my finger or tap the door handle until the door-look feature engages. This problem only occurs on the driver's side door handle.
Driver's seat squeaks every time I get into and out of the vehicle. I asked my local dealer to fix it and they said they couldn't find anything wrong. A dealer 3 miles away said they definitely hear the problem. Therefore; I will take my X3 to them for the next service appointment.
the handfree motion sensor works 10% of the time so I stopped even trying



Does not occur at all times.

doesn't seem to matter if you speak slowly or quickly; system frequently misinterprets addresses
loose trim; come off
excessively high wind noise in freeways. does not feel normal
Tire pressure monitor show the pressure totally absurd numbers what dealer claimed as factory recommended tire pressure. totally useless.
light at the bottom of the driver seat hanged loose. pathetic quality of installtion
it is same icon to enable the cruise control and set the cruise control. very un usual
useless navigation system. a $100 after market GPS works 100 times better.
rear right seat belt wont latch.
in night time; hot/cold knob in the center does not have blue and red color glow to figure out which way the knob should be moved to set the air temperature hot or cold. without this knob in the right position rest other controls are useless to control the air temperature.
there is no track to pull the cover smoothly. cheap design
Headliner cloth is popping out near the windshield bottom left corner. already scratches in the door panels  and center console
: Loose weatherstripping on left rear door. Replacement is on order and will be installed in the next 2 weeks.
: Rear door sensor foot control opening/closing difficult to use; sedom works
Database missing locations and street; or contain wrong information -
Many streets and locations are missing from database or not recognized. Unable to find certain locations without having to provide zip code - makes system unusable for streets traversing multiple zip codes
Foam insulation had come detached from frame; door edge was rubbing against it and causing a squeak when opening full distance. Dealer has since repaired it by glueing down the foam and the squeak is gone.
It is not possible to activate windshield wipers without also triggering headlight washers. This results in a waste of washer fluid and sometimes a dirtier hood.
Vehicle came without a cigarette lighter.
This vehicle only has a single USB port; but there is an obvious location for a connector in the glove box . It seems BMW cheaped out on a second port. Meanwhile other manufacturers of less expensive SUVs offer 3+ USB ports.

: Bubble in clear coating
Low to floor

This BMW was a dealer loaner car that had approximately 4000 miles on it when I purchased the car. For whatever reason the brake rotors were warped and cause a brake pulsing upon stopping.  The brakes and rotors were replaced within a couple of week of using the car under BMW warranty and I've not had a issue since; the car now has 14;000 miles on it.
When you shut the heating off; you actually have to look away from road in order to see if it's off since the steering wheel heat is retained for a while
After the initial pairing; Bluetooth connection was lost the second time. However; the next time pairing was successful and stay-paired.
Compared to the 5 other BMWs we have or have had; the amount of brake pressure required is much greater and the stopping 'responsiveness' seems less.
Upon first use; wiper blade assembly fell off of wiper arm. : Rear window wiper blade fell off on first usage.
the icon is not clear and difficult to understand. The auto front wiper must activate every time I start the car. The rear wiper icon is difficult to understand as well. The rear wiper control is so tiny.
It is real difficult to tell or feel whether I initiate the 3 blink turn indicator or constant turn indicator.
The clock on the cluster is blocked by the steering wheel.
The lane departure icon on the cluster is so difficult to understand. The setting is in the idrive system with other features together. It makes it so complicated to understand or set the settings.
The Navigation routes to freeway entrance instead of the actual destinations where they are next to the freeway.
The center seat's headrest in the second row is so difficult to reach. The button is so tiny and can't be reach with an normal adult finger
When the center of the second row seat is occupied; the passenger is so difficult to buckle/unfasten the buckle due to the buckle is located right underneath his/her butt.
Was a demo car with 2000 mi on it - dealership owners wife was driving it. All 4 wheel rims scratched from poor parking
Small scratches 
Either does not hear correct words or adds multiple digits to house number
The prompts to turn come too soon
: In highly congested areas looses connectivity.

Position of car was often incorrect; e.g.; in the river 100 yards from the road the car was actually on; etc.



The only compartment to put sunglasses in is located to the left of the steering well.  It is awkward to open and close esp. for a hight-handed person.  Also; if I am a passenger; the compartment is totally out of my reach and I must ask the driver to get my sunglasses for me.

glass seams very soft

the vehicle has wind noise at the roof line around the door of the body. both sides of vehicle. scale of 9
having to press down hard on the break paddle.
rear hatch area
do not understand the system pressure does not always the monitors
in the console box under a flip tray



Sunglass holder is too small





Very uncomfortable to use. They stick out too much for those trying to no use them as a step.
It sometimes doesn't work for a few hours or a day. Then; it will begin working for no apparent reason.

VERY; VERY little air comes out of the upper vents ; even with the blower on the highest setting . You have to put your hand about 6' from the outlet to feel the air. All front vents experience this problem. The dealer is too far away and it is too much trouble for me to bring it in to the dealer for repair. This problem alone will likely be the reason I never purchase a BMW again.
During engine restart; the vehicle jerks excessively. This situation was so unacceptable that it was turned off after a few days of ownership and will likely never be turned on again.
Should just open upon an easy push when doors are unlocked.  I have to punch the door really hard.



the door is hard to manually open

i have no issue with USB ports
it won't air right away especially when i try to play music.it does a while pair after i control from my phone to play my mp3


the holder is in an awkward position.


Very hard to figure out self-parking feature and is not intuitive at all.  I even had the manual with me and walked through it step by step but it took several parking attempts for it to work.
I had added the 'M' brakes to this vehicle; and they work well; however; they 'squeak' when coming to a complete stop .
The steering wheel does not tilt downward as much as previous models of the BMW X6.  I had a 2012 X6 before this 2015 model; and the wheel would go down farther.  This wheel; even in its lowest setting; makes me feel like I'm 'reaching' to steer. : The steering wheel has electric controls to move the position of the wheel.  The wheel itself doesn't go down as low as previous X6 modeal .  I cannot seem to get the steering wheel comfortably low enough where I'm not 'reaching' for the wheel.
You cannot 'deflate' the lumbar support completely.  My preference is not to have the lumbar support pushing into my back; but even in the most deflated mode; it is still present.

Controls are too low and too far back on the seat not much spacing between seat and car door
Unable to attain enough height. Not able to differentiate the height button from the forward or backward buttons. Pressing height button tends to bring the seat forward a little
Seat belt latch sits too low and too close to the drivers seat; making it difficult to latch the seat belt
rear taillight was defective and dealer required 9 days in the shop to diagnose and fix.
Currently; the left fog light comes on with the automatic headlight feature.  The right fog light does not come one.  problem just occurred and have a dealer appointment.
: The Bluetooth connection to my cell phone would drop calls frequently for about a month; then stopped being a problem.   The head's up display stopped working for 3 days; then came back on.  Both these problems fixed themselves before I could get it to the dealer.

Have had other vehicles with cooled seats that worked very effectively.  These don't really work to cool at all.
Dealer could not find problem; but it went away : The car had a Driveline Malfunction warning for 24 hours.  Dealer checked it and ordered a new vanos solenoid.  Part has not been installed yet; but the problem has gone away.
I had a 2012 x6; it seemed tighter; I understand this is supposed to be an upgrade to the new model
Fuel door would not unlock upon car being unlocked and was unable to open the door. Green safety cord found in trunk would not open the door either.
The fuel door locks and unlocks with the central locking mechanism. The unlock function does not successfully free the door so the emergency release must be used. The materials  seem to stick or be mis-aligned. This happened the first time I had to add fuel and each time since.
: Front bumper parking assist sensor overly sensitive or activating needlessly
FREQUENTLY; INSIDE HANDLE MOVES BUT DOOR DOES NOT OPEN EXCEPT WITH A SHOULDER PUSH OUT. TOOK IT BACK TO DEALERSHIP; THEY FIXED IT & WERE VERY EFFICIENT & COURTEOUS.
Misinterprets names once in awhile
Phone does not disconnect when car stopped
Actuator was faulty.  Had to return to dealer to get it fixed
Just stopped working.  Tried to reset to no avail.
Have to manually pair over and over again
Heads up Display stopped working for two weeks.
it just won't open! I have to use emergency release in the trunk to get it opened



I can not open the fuel cap
Sunglasses storage door does not open without effort
While on a call the bluetooth disconnect and cant hear through the car speakers most of the time; at that point have to use my phone speaker or flick through switches to reconnect.
Brakes are under-powered for weight of vehicle.
The actuator was illfitted. It wouldn't disengage from 'locked'; wouldn't open. The actuator had to be shaved to fit to enable proper functioning b
It's wistles lightly; making me check to see if. All windows are up- which they are.
LOCING LATCH HAD TO BE DISENGAGED BY SALESMAN SO FUEL COULD BE ADDED. YET  TO BE REPAIRED
Bluetooth wont pair with phone intermittantly
The latch was of line; it was repaired immediately
Interior right side door panel light
When you try to open fron out side is not open; you must push hard and stick your finger on the ga' and pull.
The gas door wouldn't open more than once. It was taken to the dealer for repair.
: Bluetooth doesn't work properly when trying to sync with my phone.
: Oil was leaking from the transmission.
It took one half hour to open the first time I had to fill up.
Just chipped paint. It has been taken care of.
When driving to California from Las Vegas on interstate 15.
Have to hit the horn hard to get it to work. Can't just tap it.
When the two paired phones are in the car;sometimes the phone book will not come on. I then have to pair up the two phones & theneverything is o.k.
If it is a cool nite and we start the car after it's been sitting outside. It takes a few minutes to clear once I turn on the defoggers.
broken locking/unlicking mechanizam
paint quality is too cheap
a scratch on cealing area
will not open. Open and close locks still does not work. At first thought may be frozen because of cold weather. Brought it in. Fixed. Now having problem again
THERE SHOULD BE AN 'ON' INDICATOR LIGHT ON INSTRUMENT PANEL
SOUNDS LIKE A LOW WHISTLE....NOISE ABATES WHEN FAN SPEED CHANGED...
The door would not open easily whenever I needed gas. It was a source of anxiety. I took the car to the dealership and found out the door was malfunctioning and the part needed to fix it had to be ordered. I haven't taken the car back as yet; but I was not contacted either that the part was available and ready to be fixed. : The gas pump release door has been difficult to open and every time I needed gas; it was a source of anxiety.
I can't remember how to adjust the mirror and haven't been able to adjust it yet. I'm scheduled to review this feature at the dealership next week.
Had to remove the internal panel in order to access fuel door release - on two separate occasions.  Seems to be ok now.
the nav system is terrible.
When there are to-go cups in the front cup holders; the CD eject and all the preset buttons are covered up and therefore hard to use.  This wasn't an issue in the previous version of the X6.
Its having a problem with a toll road.  It keeps telling me to exit one exit early.  With addresses on highways; it frequently goes to the wrong place.  Also with addresses on highways; it doesn't tell you to exit.  It somehow thinks its 'on the highway'.





Sometimes the right blind spot monitoring does not work.
: I connect my iphone to the audio system of the car through BlueTooth; when I play some songs in the phone and it auto-parse very frequently. Especially when it goes to the next song.




too many steps to turn car off

warning notice seems to happen without cause.

notifies me of road hazards that aren't there.  Does not notify me of hazards that are present.


: use of electric on/off

This is a matter of researching how this should work.

Does not understand my accent; and I speak English very well. I do not want to yell in my vehicle.
: The vehicle takes a longer time to warm up; maybe the winter this time was too brutal.
If I try to enter a new destination by voice command it never understands what Isay!
Haven't yet been able to figure out how to adjust the height of the rear seat headrests despite reading the manual. : Headrest justment.
: Usually when I use the seat heating feature the heaters are turned off when I turn the car off and need to be restarted when I start the car up again.  I believe this is how they are supposed to work.  Occasionally though the heaters come back on by themselves when the car is restarted. Also usually my display defaults to range but sometimes it comes up in compass.  The fact that these hardware/software features are not consistent is both annoying and alarming.
Garage door opener not programed
: memory seats didn't adjust automatically; I had to push the memory button a few times to adjust the seat.
: due to inexperience; I'm still learning how to control or maintain the desired temperature in the vehicle. I always have to manipulate the controls multiple times a day to get the desired temperature.
driver center vent doesn't adjust close enough towards me.
Compared to other vehicles I've owned; the X6 seats don't get that warm.
: rain and other water residue on bottom of doors





I SCUFF MY PANT LEGS GETTING OUT OF THE VEHICLE.  REALLTY DON'T KNOW WHY BMW EVER INSTALLED THEM.  MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL!  PLEASE RID OF THEM IN FUTURE PRODUCTION.
there is a rattle on the left door where the lighting system and sound system are located.  i will have fixed on my first service call
this is a defect that i will deal with on my first service call
Its just loud; even when its on lowest fan mode !
bluetooth does not comminicate well with media
The A/C was leaking onto the driver's floor mat. : The A/C was leaking onto the driver's floor mat.
When the vehicle first starts; once the ventilation system starts; there is a rattle that comes from behind the middle air vents in the front seat.  The rattle starts after about a minute or so of the vehicle starting.  The rattle lasts for under 10 seconds and never comes back.  The rattle only occurs when the vehicle has been sitting for a while.  If the vehicle has just been driven or doesn't sit for more than an hour or so; the rattle doesn't occur when the vehicle starts.  The dealership states that it is probably some part of the internal  ventilation system that is opening up and potentially getting caught or dragging on something.  However; the only fix/way to make a diagnosis would be to take the ENTIRE dashboard apart so they could investigate further; which I declined because the noise seems not as big of a deal as tearing the whole dashboard apart and any resulting problems from that.
Driver Restraint System Malfunction.   Continue to wear safety belt.   Consult Nearest Service Center.
I ask to search for a song title; on the Ipod; and it asks if i want to change the climate; or the clock. It repeats back something I didn't say. I re pronounce the words clearly; louuder; and it sometimes works and sometimes asks if i want to do something else. Then most times; it works!????!!!!
Looks likely there are no option for wipers to control. only 2 option slow or fast.
indicator should be larger
: Traffic information  in the navigation system are often not accurate
: Heated seats get a little too hot even at lowest setting
Does not recognize addresses via voice command all of the time. Will find addresses in other states even though you indicate otherwise. Points of interest without an address is hit or miss and not clear if it actually providing the guidance when it does recognize points of interest. It should say guidance started when using poi but does not. This is the biggest problem with this car.
Fan from seat cooler made an unusual noise as if the fan was loose when I first received car. After leaning back to put my wallet in my back pocket the noise went away. Not sure that the seat cooler is working but haven't had time to get it checked.
I can't keep them clean.   Could be the color; not a defect.
My carpet and door panels are very light beige.  They show little pieces of dirt.  I cannot keep them clean.  I should probably have gotten dark carpeting in the car.
: A warning light came on saying the vehicle was out of level or something and when I brought it to a dealership; they said the computer had some information programmed incorrectly.  The problem was resolved. I'm not sure if it will happen again.

I bought a hard/washable mat for the trunk space from the dealer-cost $200. I think this mat should have come standard with the vehicle. Hard/washable front and second row mats should come standard as well.



Whenever I turn the engine on; the AC does not get cold fast enough. Have to wait for it to get cold
If I tell it to call a certain number; it will come up with a number of wrong numbers or answers; probably doesn't know me yet.
For some unknown reason I had to reconnect my I-phone up again.  It just came unconnected.
Manual does not quite tell you how to operate; had to go the dealer for instructions and fixed it  right away
: Bluetooth and USB integration consistently malfunctions and freezes.
I'm southern; and although I wouldn't go so far as to say I have a southern drawl ; the navigation system never recognizes my voice and consistently misinterprets what I say. In addition the Navigation system is highly confusing and difficult to use. When it does work it's wonderful; the Head Up display provides visual cues as to where to go; but getting it to work is often not worth the hassle. It's nearly impossible to use while the vehicle is moving; even using the voice controls and pretty much impossible to effect a manual input into the system as the wheel/dial device used for input is cumbersome and inaccurate.   It's often times much easier just to use Siri on my iPhone and allow it to guide me  than to use the in-car system. I almost never use the in car navigation system because the built in voice recognition sucks so badly.
When connected using bluetooth the volume for music/phone calls is significantly lower than when connected via USB. Also; when connected via bluetooth the system will frequently not recognize commands. For instance; if you select a particular song from your iPhone; the system will freeze up and default back to the first song in your song list; even if you were selecting a song from a playlist. So for instance if you wanted to play a song by Lil Wayne and you select that song using either the Head Up display or the dial; it will default to the first alphabetized song in your iphone that starts with the letter 'A'. This happens CONSTANTLY is it is super annoying for a car that costs so much. : Bluetooth and USB integration consistently malfunctions and freezes.

Again; the system is visually stunning; but functionally deficient. It's not inaccurate because it can't find it; it's inaccurate because you can't input the data in a reasonble amount of time and it takes too long to find the actual street.
Key fob does not consistently work to open doors.  We have to use the unlock button on fob to open doors; however we have not brought this to BMW's attention.
: Passenger side seatbelt warning came on without any passenger or item in the seat. Ultimately the dealer had to order/replace the seat cushion which contains the sensor.
Not very good quality of paint when I picked it up on 27JAN15 and paint is chipping on front of vehicle. I hand wash my vehicle weekly ; therefore I notice imperfections. Just noticed these chips on Saturday so I have not contacted the dealer yet.
Thus USB port in the center armrest is at the bottom of the compartment where other items block it's location. It should be placed higher up at the top of the compartment.
When turning on the seat cooling; you barely feel anything.
The leather has creases and/or 'bubbles' where is should look tight and well-formed in a couple of places on both the driver and passenger seats.
When I want to turn on the heat; there is no single button to do so. I have to turn the temperature to maximum to get the heat to come on immediately. There should be a simple button to turn on heat when you want it right away. Setting a temperature and waiting for heat to come on is not convenient.
The carpets to the immediate left to seat and immediately behind the brake pedal soil easily. You tend to put your feet at these areas when getting in and out of the car. I bought the rubber floor mats and they do not extend high enough to cover the carpet behind the brake pedal to protect the carpet. Another 4 inches higher would have been perfect.
When turning on the A/C; I smell a musty unpleasant smell. Friends have told me their new cars also experience this smell. Not sure if it is oils put on the air filters or what but it does smell unpleasant.

The height is not adjustable; so the seat belt doesn't cross my chest in the correct place .


i am not sure that is a problem. the brake system is ok. just when i hang D and stepped on the brake__ÔøΩthat a little noiseÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ
The seat ventilation does not noticeably cool on highest setting. I can hear the fans; but I cannot feel the ventilation.
The front driver side door was misaligned at delivery; resulting in us having to return the vehicle a couple days after delivery so that it could be prepared. The dealership believes it may have happened during shipping from the factory.
When the panoramic sunroof is fully opened; the wind causes an annoying vibrating sound within the vehicle that can only be resolved by cracking a door window.
You have to lean forward to reach to the front passenger side window control.
The use of outside lock/unlock function is not intuitive and doesn't seem to want to unlock all doors at once.
The vehicle ignition occasionally turns off when fully stopped before pressing the ignition off; then when exiting the vehicle it's possible to forget that you never actually turned the ignition off because the engine is not running. On a couple occasions this has resulted in coming back to the vehicle later to find the engine running idle.
The panel that surrounds the gear shifter was misaligned; causing one corner of it to be raised up as if it wasn't properly clicked into place. Vehicle was returned to the dealer so that they could properly align the piece.
It took 3 trips to BMW dealer to finally replace the sensors






It is a whirring sound from the spinning of the gears
In daylight fine; after dark with traffic can't see to use; perhaps partly due to bifocals
noise/popping sound left side sunroof.  It only happens when it's wet and is intermittent.
Locks appear to have electrical issues - when car is first started each day; licks will repeatedly lock & unlock; or try unsuccessfully to lock; or try unsuccessfully to unlock.
The architecture of the navigation control system is not intuitive.  Furthermore; it is very difficult to input new addresses because it will reject any address that is not input in exactly the format that the system is looking for it to be in.  This limitation is not present in Garmin or Apple Mapping and Navigation systems.
It is not unusual for it to map a route that is not optimum; not consistent with driver-inputted preferences; and in some cases; makes not sense.

Works like all other built-in navigation systems that I've had on vehicles .  Is not reliable off the interstate system in rural areas nor in cities with complex street layouts .  If I'm in an unfamiliar area; I always try to find paper maps or use Google maps when there's cell phone service...
On the auto setting the ac does not blow at maximum and then cycle down as it gets closer to the desired temp. Have to manually hit the max ac button and then turn off after several minutes to reach desired temp.
Poor instruction on how to connect with an ipod. The BMW accessory cable did not work. I finally found out through forums that you needed to use the ipod factory cable.
Gets names wrong. Also does not let you specify a specific number from the start. For example Diane; mobile. It finds Diane and then says there are 3 numbers; select the number on line 1; 2 or 3 etc..
With the seat raised up and wearing a heavy coat; the female portion is a litte to low and hard to reach
actually the problem isn't with the clock. It's with teh dual monitor. I wanted to have certain widgets appear from BMW online in the dual monitor and it would only display the clock.
The heads-up display did not come on 2 within the first 60 days even though it was selected properly.



front seats are not comfortable as have been in earlier models.seat bottoms need to be somewhat wider and seat side bolsters are too firm which contributes to problem.
Assuming that we are Asian-American; so our accents are not perfect. We just do not use the voice command.
When the address indicate liked Route 76; the navigation doesn't have the option to put on. We had to go back and google by our phone to get the exactly area code for the address to make it work.
first experienced these problems when the temperature was very cold outside and it was snowing.  no problems with warm temperatures.
it was very cold and snowy outside that made opening the door very difficult.
useless.  Vehicle does not need running boards!
: Windshield had orange peel appearance and had to be replaced
Metal has been discolored with spots due to snow/water/ mag chloride. Will be checking with dealer this month to see why or how to remove/clean
When I try to use voice command to enter an address into the GPS it doesn't recognize what I say and tries to send us to Mexico instead of Jacksonville; FL. I am a radiologist who uses speech recognition software. I know what the Dragon engine is capable of and your system is 10 years behind the times. We don't use the voice command system because it is so bad and even though we love the car; we decided against purchasing a second BMW because of how bad the iDrive/voice command system it. You need touch screen controls like our old 2008 Acura TL. Surprisingly; it was a superior system. We'll go back to BMW if you fix iDrive and the incredibly bad voice recognition system. Also; I should be able to say 'Directions. Closest Ruth's Chris Steakhouse' and it should get me there. My phone can do that; why not my $74;000 car? Instead; I can't even say 'Directions. 131 Maple Street Jacksonville; Florida' and actually get directions. It tries to send us to Mexico or some other incorrect address
Sometimes the phone isn't recognized by the car; so we have to shut the phones down and restart them. After doing so; the car usually recognizes them. Inconvenient.
The car does not understand our voice commands. It is extremely difficult to use. We basically just gave up and use our iPhone google maps app to directions because it is so difficult and inconvenient to try to get the GPS to recognize our voices and destination addresses.  I have a 2008 Acura TL-S and it has a vastly superior touch screen navigation system. That's absurd. I had heard that iDrive was a problem; but I chose to ignore the critics and try it for myself. It's below average and that's being polite. I should be able to say 'Directions to Disney's Grand Floridian; Bay Lake Florida' and it should take me there. Instead; I have to google an address with my phone. Then; when I try to speak in the address with voice commands the BMW won't understand what I'm saying. Then; I try to manually enter the address with that stupid spinning dial thing  and it becomes a laborious process. It's a HORRIBLE nav sys and interface.
The ventilated seats are almost a worthless option. They do not cool well. You almost can't feel anything at all. Don't think I'd buy this option again unless you make them more powerful/useful.
When driver 1 and driver 2 enter the locked car; the car frequently fails to switch the memory seat to the driver's preferred setting. For example. Driver 1 parks the car. Turns off the engine. Locks the door. Later; Driver 2 uses comfort access to unlock the driver's door. Enters the car. The driver's seat will often NOT change it's adjustment to driver 2. Likewise; when you go to the settings menu and manually select the profile for driver 2 with the car running; but in park; the seat will NOT move to the correct position. So; after selecting profile 2 you have to manually hold the seat adjustment profile button on the side of the driver's seat to get the seat into the correct position. AND; you have to manually hold that button down until the seat has completely shifted into correct position. If you take your finger off the button before the transition is complete; the seat stops moving. ANNOYING.
I have canberra beige Dakota seats. They stain every time I sit on them on denim or other dark fabrics. This is absurd. I have had white and taupe nappa leathers from other manufacturers and NEVER had this problem.  My two month old leather seats look 8 years old; now. I won't ever buy Dakota Canberra Beige again; because the seats are now turning dark blue/black from my blue jeans. Again; my Honda products never had this problem.
: There is a rotating hook on the driver's side of the cargo pay. It flips open and closed and is used to hook plastic grocery store bags to keep them upright and prevent cargo from moving around in the cargo area. This hook is located on the vertical wall of the cargo bay.  The first time I used it  it worked fine. However; when I tried to flip it back to a closed position; it would not return to its native position.  I placed my finger in the space to assess what was preventing it from properly closing and I realized that it is catching on a wiring harness.  I tried to push the harness back; but it is too stiff.  This is not something I would take the car to the dealer to repair; because I think they would do more harm than good and probably break something in the process.  After I finally got the hook to flip back in place; we decided to never use this hook feature again. Minor problem with a very easy solution.
sounds like something loose when closing door
: excessive noise/whistling when fan is on high speed
when i shut the door
The usb port is inside the center console which is very difficult to use when in the driver's seat.

Dust and dirt from the kids shoes end up on the back of the front seats and middle row seats daily. The car must be professionally cleaned in order to fully remove the dirt/dust.


So narrow almost impossible to use.
bumper has a half inch long gash in it at time of delivery
: My drivers seat belt was not installed properly.  it has a twist in it.  it needs to be re-installed
A small chip on painted door handle; they ordered new one and replaced it
When speaking the persons name to search in phone book to dial gets wrong name always annoying not using anymore
Napa leather very playable and soft but starting to show creases where mostly used passenger;even little things like buttons on jeans or zippers easily scratch it
Engine light came on;took it in they told me one of the injectors was bad ;replaced it with new one ;and it's been fine up to now


When starting the car early in the morning in the cold weather backing out of my driveway I hear the brakes squeak.


You have to have the door open when switching to a different memory setting for it to go to that setting automatically.  Otherwise with the door shut you have to hold the button down until it stops.  That's inconvenient.

It does not feel like the AC gets to the temperature set; .e.g you need to go down to 60 for the flow to increase. May be the flow is getting colder - difficult to say but; definitely not blowing more intesely. It does not feel anything changes.
Why can't I have a net pocket behind the fron seat which I can fit a bottle of wine in; like in Audi. BMW pockets are useless - nothing fits there.

At random times; the navigation screen would go completely black and only display the words 'NO SIGNAL'.
Trunk/hatch/tailgate doesn't open completely everytime. It differs if you open it using the key or manually. It goes 2/3rds of the day and I have to push the remaining.
: It is primarily to do with Vehicle status. Whenever we start the vehicle; it shows a warning that tire pressure is too low and we should stop the vehicle. However it builds up pretty fast once we start driving for sometime but the warning sign doesn't go away. Even if the pressure is more than 30 psi; we still get the same warning sign. BMW dealership guy also asked us to ignore it. But when you have such a costly vehicle which is known for its interiors; handling of TPM should be pretty basic. It should not show that TP goes up and down by 8-10 psi everyday
not too much; but sometimes it's noticeable
The center console cup holders are fine.  Door storage for cup / drink containers lags behind less expensive vehicles.  BMW needs to address ease of use; specific drink containers for the doors 
: It's a design issue--seatbelt set up in the back seat makes it impossible to put a car seat for a baby in the middle position  and still be able to use the seatbelts for the 2 outside seats.  The car seat covers the seatbelts.  So I had to put my car seat in an outside/window seat.
: Sometimes the music player has trouble connecting to the iPhone.
The aux cable and usb port right above and under each other. It's difficult to plug in the AUX when the USB port is still in.
Tire failed for unknown reason - needed replacement
: I have a new phone with the same sim card- the bluetooth system no longer connects to my phone- I have not been able to find the solution in the system and will have to go back to the dealer for help-
: fan/blower malfunction caused battery to completely drain out
Tire pressure monitoring system is so sensitive that we had to take it to dealer to be checked; and inspection showed that pressure was off by only 4/10s of a pound.
ECO PRO is a mystery.
Horn does not sound when pressed in middle of horn.  I have to press around the edges.

The whole system is overly complex.  Many times when I want to make a phone call; it says that there are no phone numbers entered; when I know that my whole list of cell phone numbers are in there.  Also; many times it says 'No Bluetooth available.'  Then I have to take my cell phone out of my purse to make the phone call.
Height adjustment control does not operate in a vertical mode.  It operates only diagonally.  It feels like you are going to fall out of the seat.  I cannot adjust it into a comfortable position.
See previous comments.


A few days after delivery; it was as mild day with higher humidity around 75 degrees.  I ran the AC for the first time for around 30 minutes. The car was parked overnight.  The next day; the car stunk like water and mold; and there was dried water on the rear passenger side floor and center transmission hump.  There was also what looked to be dried water coming out of the rear HVAC vents.  This event occurred only this one time and thus I did not take the car to the dealer.
The gas pedal location feels to close to the right side of the console; and the curvature of the console encroaches on leg room and pushes the right leg inward to the left.  The gas pedal seems too far forward causing the right leg to be scrunched up. The driver's seat goes back only so far and does not alleviate this position.
: At times and randomly; the iDrive system does not recognize that my iPhone 5s is connected via USB; and rarely it will not connect or recognize via bluetooth. It is a rare problem happening maybe 5 times since delivery.
I am unclear as to when the surround view cameras should come on. It does not come on when in reverse.
: Drivers side; floor vent was blowing cold air when rest of heating system was blowing warm air. This problem only happened once and has not reoccurred.
Difficult to find the latch to open.
one ding at back of vehicle on driver side
small dings in paint on front bumper
rear view mirror has multiple buttons that are not well defined
: Wind noise around driver's window.
: Discoloration on some of the exterior window molding.
Roof rails are solid - without any open space to tie anything to without purchasing a BMW branded accessory.
The Bluetooth connection to a iPhone 5 . The iPhone has to be rebooted for the Bluetooth to reconnect
Door storage areaand rear hatch are made of cheap  plastic that makes noise if you put ANYTHING in them. When items slide in the pockets during normal driving conditions; they make a loud scratching noise.

Voice recognition should not be so difficult
makes up words
Too many steps in driver information display to get to the action you want to accomplish
Need to feel around on steering wheel shaft to find control.
Menu structure overly complex
gets stuck in the terminal  extended position and needs force to retract
Read that this is a common problem. Not that bad I can live witht that
I finally figured out to say  'stop'  when  I  wanted to cancel  the route
: The voice connect with the navigation system could be better
: The quantity of outside fresh air could be better; although not a significant problem.


: rear doors only unlock using the fob or button on door.  Cannot unlock back doors if keys on your person by simply pulling on handle
After three calls the parity stops working and it won't reconnect. then need to reboot system
Instructions are not easily access; still haven't figure out the voice comments
Glove box without lock
Driver's seat leather was double folding .

around door seals; paint is uneven






they are uncomfortable

Very disappointed in mpg....much lower than expected
Memory does not work Memory on fob does not work
Can not connect to the internet; BMW widget app.
During after market window tinting it was discovered that there was about a six inch long scratch in the passenger window; window was replaced  at no cost to me.

New car smell
There are too many steps that ask for confirmation after entering an address or voice command. The system could automatically jump to beginning guidance to the desired location but asks for confirmation at nearly every step. It's additional clicks and affirmation.
The center console has an iphone connector that I don't use and didn't buy the additional pieces but is not able to be removed. Need more storage!
There is not an overhead console - would be really nice!

The USB and AUX ports are inside the center console space.  But; if you want to store things in the center console with a USB stick or AUX connector plugged in; then it is difficult to place other things in the console or retrieve things from the center console.
Dark blue jeans transfer dye to the light colored leather.
Noticed by person who took me to pick up vehicle and then keep noticing problem. This dealership has changed ownership since I first started working with them 19 years ago. they were very knowledgeable and workable in the old days. Now seems like I know product better than sales reps and not real sure about service dept. Feel very uncomfortable with this dealership.

Does not seem to understand commands most of the time.
Most times it will connect but have had to delete device and then reinstall a couple of times.



This has always been the worst feature with BMW. The heating/air is difficult to use and control.
This is second X3 and other was and M class It got better gas mileage. This one is using way to much gas in normal driving.
Looked to be over spray On tailgate top.
Feels like the drivers door is misaligned as the road noise is much higher than I would have expected for this vehicle.  Most prominent when travelling at high speeds not noticeable at all times.  All door tends to not sit properly when in an open position - trying to shut or swing open again suggesting perhaps not aligned/installed properly.
: The HD option on the radio works poorly which I think is more a product of the location of the radio towers around Baltimore than the radio itself - it goes in and out of HD mode during a song.  I have turned the HD mode off which allows for better listening.
X3 has the capability for Hatch Back release using a foot proximity sensor when the Key Fob is within sensing distance to the car.  This option rarely works even if the fob is held close to the car. Salesperson demonstration also encountered this problem.  It simply does not work well.

light scratch
Frustrating to use - I only use with NAV; and usually have to go to the manual input
Door handle pinches hand when opening driver door



not that user friendly for older people.
You have to lock the car or the battery runs down.  The electronics is too much for battery.  BMW missed the mark on this.
The heater actually runs hot on top vents even when those vents have not been selected so trying to keep feet warm is difficult as they don't heat well while the main vent on left dashboard is too hot making it uncomfortable. Body and head get too hot while feet not warm enough.
Rattles above driver when driving. Medium loud rattle so medium annoyance at this time but could see it becoming more annoying on longer trips.
The latch to open is sideways and hard to use. Vehicle manual doesn't fit well so makes it hard to close. It is small as well.
The cigarette lighter doesn't also work as a phone charger.  The only phone charger is in the center console which is inconvenient.
My run flat tire was punctured 3 months after purchase.  I had to buy a new tire for the front passenger wheel.  very expensive

Scratch on driver door

a few small scratches on the hood of the car
the auto feature is not very good and the speed operation is a little difficult to understand
Sometimes does not pair with phone but works a majority of the time. Restart of phone and car needed
Doesn't recognize 'Home' in navigation saved addresses.  Periodically doesn't recognize places I ask for.  However; easy to use voice commands.

It will not tilt down enough


Noisy on start up
IF THE DRIVER OR THE PASSENGER GETS OUT OF THE VEHICLE;THERE SHOULD BE A ON/OFF FEATURE IN THE LOCKING SET UP TO ALLOW ALL DOORS TO UNLOCK  BY THE DRIVER'S DISCRETION. MY AUDI Q7 HAD THIS FEATURE. IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING TO GET OUT OF THE CAR TO TAKE OUT GROCERIES; BACKPACK; ETC. ONLY TO REALIZE YOU FORGOT TO UNLOCK ALL THE DOORS PRIOR TO STEPPING OUT OF THE VEHICLE.  THE AUTOMATIC WIPERS NEED ANOTHER SPEED BETWEEN THE LOW AND HIGH. : IT IS DIFFICULT TO VIEW THE TURN SIGNALS UNLESS I MOVE THE STEERING WHEEL UP; WHERE I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE IT LOWER.
THE REAR SENSOR IS A GREAT FEATURE; BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A CHOICE TO PUT IT ON MANUAL. I HAVE BEEN IN MY GARAGE; AND DID NOT WANT THE HATCH TO OPEN ALL OF THE WAY.
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY! MY HUSBAND AND TECHNO-SMART 15-YEAR-OLD HAVE ALL HAD PROBLEMS WITH IT. I HAVE NOT TAKEN THIS TO THE DEALER; OR WATCHED THE VIDEO ON USING IT. WE END UP USING THE MANUAL TECHNIQUE RATHER THAN WHAT SHOULD BE THE EASE OF GIVING AUDIO DIRECTIONS. WE HAVE USED NAVIGATION SYSTEMS FOR OVER 10 YEARS AND THIS HAS BEEN THE HARDEST SYSTEM TO USE. ONCE THE DIRECTIONS ARE PUT INTO THE SYSTEM IT IS GREAT!
: THE INTERIOR TRIM OF THE DOORS COLLECTS FUZZ EASILY.  IT IS NOT A PRACTICAL DOOR TRIM FINISH.




Needed new engine chip.
Sometimes it doesn't recognized voice commands.  Nothing major; just got use to not using it.
Doesn't list step by step of directions like the garmin does.
: SEAT IS NOT CUSHION ENOUGH; I'M A SHORT PERSON AND COULDN'T ADJUST HIGH ENOUGH TO MY SATISFACTION

Hard to locate the spot to press to honk horn.
After a while of cooling it seems like there is no cold air coming out regardless of the temp setting it's on.
icons difficult to understand
: low lightinging
sunglass compartment too small
Clicking noise when turning wheel
The driver side mirror doesn't adjust down to face the ground when the car is in reverse.  The passenger side mirror does adjust down.
: On the center console; the buttons for menu; radio; telephone; etc are in a difficult spot to reach from the drivers side.  You need to go around the gear shift and can't see the labels on the buttons from the standard driving position.

A few times now when I went to open the driver side door my finger got pinched!  It hurts every time.  I am now careful how I grip/place my hand on the handle so I don't get pinched/hurt.
: With regard to foot pedals; if they are adjustable I do not know how to adjust them.  If I am wearing heels I can NOT easily move my foot from the brake to the gas pedal.  My heel hits the side of gas pedal.  This has caused a few dangerous experiences on the road because I couldn't accelerate fast enough and thought I was going to be hit by oncoming traffic.

Sometimes when I use my finger to lock and/or unlock door it just doesn't work; and I don't know why.  I have the fob in my purse or pocket; etc.; but the keyless entry doesn't work and so I have to reach in my purse and use the button on my fob to unlock door.

I think it is more accurate to say that the car has just a few 'pairing/connectivity issues.'  Also; it appears my car has ability to display text messages; but I have tried a handful of times to figure it out; and I can't figure it out.
I wish I could provide more details.  I just find it very confusing.  I typically just use the map on my Iphone because it is simpler.

The storage unit is small and it it is hard for me to reach under the phone console to get what I need.
When I plug in my ipod; I get an error message.
Sometimes I hear a static sound while speaking on the phone.  It is annoying.  Also; the bluetooth does not automatically pair multiple phones.
Over the weekend; I provided a specific address and typed it into the navigation system.  It sent me to the wrong address.  I had to pull over and call a family member to help me find the location which was 3.5 miles away from where the navigation system sent me.
There is a gap with the rubber on both the front driver and front passenger doors.
The mat does not stay put so I took it out.  It gets stuck underneath gas peddle and I get concerned that it will cause a car accident.
The car has orders but not always.
I will give it an voice command in the read back it has misspelled what I said
: Steering wheel blocks the speedometer + does not adjust down far enough

side vents don't clear up the side windows condensation fast enough
when we turn on the maximum air conditioning feature; the side vents don't blow cold air. The temperature in general doesn't get cold enough.
: My son doesn't get enough air with his rear facing car seat
You always hit your leg getting in and out of the SUV and the salesman is aware.
Carpet mats need to cover up the whole second row and need to be overall much wider.
wont hold air.
Have to look around steering column to locate switch.
I am not up to date on modern electronics -age problem?  You can not operate system while driving and keep your eyes on the road.


The wipers do not properly clean the windshield on the passenger side; they do not seem to make firm contact with windshield on that side of the car at the maximum sweep distance and leave a smeared windshield; even when using the washer function. Wipers were replaced but the problem is not completely remedied; as there is still smearing on the passenger side of the windshield.





For a luxury SUV; I was expecting the vehicle to be less quiet at highway speeds from wind and road noise.
For a luxury SUV; I would expect less road noise.
Difficult to use; hard to operate to shut down car and lights/accessories; if foot is on pedal; then pressing button starts the car - this can sometimes be mistake for a shutdown sequence.
Occasionally there is a fluttering noise when first turning on A/C. Sometimes A/C seems to be on and cooler air than outside is coming out of vents even though A/C is off. Sometimes A/C doesn't come on immediately. Will be taking to dealer to investigate shortly since we just had a bit of warm weather in the So CA winter and am using A/C more than normal.
This vehicle is the largest car/SUV I have owned; yet it has the smallest glove box of all.
The vinyl seats smell like chemicals - I miss my leather seats. Hoping that someday the smell will be to a lesser extent.
I turn the know to adjust the auto temperature and the fan speed never changes.  I would expect that once it reach the proper temperature; that the fan would slow down and maintain the temp.

Left brand new car overnight to have it light changed.
Driver's side exterior mirror motor had to be replaced.
Satellite radio fades out momentarily frequently. Dealer tested vehicle as well as a new one.   Operation is as to be expected in urban areas was their conclusion.  I feel the radio fades out when it shouldn't.   I have had satellite radio for 10 years prior in two different cars and did not have this difficulty in urban areas.
Instrument cluster window smudged on the inside.
When I connect an iPod; there is no control for forwarding /backwarding  musics; on the steering wheel .  So; I need to use the front panel to do so; which is located farmost. Since I use this every day; it is very inconvenient.
A road is viewed by 2 lanes . Such view is terribly confusing. I like to see only one lane for one road. Last time; you used arrow to show traffics. It was better than the current one . You may use a red arrow for heavy; or something else. Multiple lane view is really bad. Please change it.
This is my 4th BMW and the breaks seem weak on this car.
At slow speeds the steering makes a wheezy out of breath sound.
The heated steering wheel switch is in a horrible location.  All BMWs should put it on the steering wheel.
Not intuitive to use.
There seems to be a slight rattle near the transmission when traveling on rough roads.

When ever the phone is paired on Bluetooth in the car; it automatically changes my phone to vibrate for all notifications

They are so narrow you can't even really get a foot on them; I think they are more dangerous than helpful as they are the height of my shins so I bang into them more than anything.
it's from the sunroof.
The built in plastic unit for iPhone connection takes up too much space and is not removable.
Heavy resistance when trying to open and put rear hatch up


There is dye transfer from Coats to the seats and center arm rest






: The exterior look more dirty than it actually is; probably a better paint job would help.
: The all weather floor mat get dirty soon and does not feel good quality.

adapter can't be removed and takes up too much of an already small compartment
no power from source
scratches on the wood grain surface by the gear shift.  pin like scratches.  I pointed it out but have not made an appointment to have it further investigated.
Last X5 stopped immediately;this x5 keeps going and requires more foot pressure on brakes.
Car not heavy enough. Last 2009 X5 was more sturdy.


NICE CAR; WELL BUILT.  MUCH ROUGHER RIDE THAT PORSCHE CAYENNE THAT I HAD FOR 3.5 YEARS.
CAN NOT SEE WITH MAUI JIM SUNGLASSES. DEALER SAID TO; 'BUY A CHEAP PAIR FOR DRIVING BMW!! POLARIZED WON'T WORK!'
SHORT ON POWER
I wish I could include a photo with this survey. The passenger rear side molding is misaligned and is quite noticeable. The driver rear side molding is also slightly off.
I wish I could include a photo with this survey. The frame does not line up at all on the rear passenger side; right by the window. It is also slightly off on the rear driver side.
It takes a lot of power on the brake pedal to make the vehicle brake. I didn't have to exert that much power on previous vehicles.
The passenger side windshield wiper does not touch the window. In Wisconsin winter; this makes it extremely difficult to see. I took the issue to MotorWorks BMW in Minneapolis to get addressed. I was told that BMW only replaced windshield wiper blades once a year and they thought that was the problem. I explained that I just bought the vehicle one month ago and that shouldn't happen. The issue was not resolved. I then took the vehicle to Bergstrom BMW in Appleton the following weekend. They put on new wiper blades and said the issue was taken care of. However; after another snowfall and added salt on the roadway; I used the wipers and the issue still exists. I cannot see out of the passenger side of the windshield as the wiper is not touching the window. The same is true for the rear window wiper. : The passenger side windshield wiper does not touch the window. In Wisconsin winter; this makes it extremely difficult to see.

Sometimes the system just doesn't understand what I'm requesting it to do. I end up inputting the information manually.
When using the rear seat belt; it twists at times; making it unable to retract properly.
I took the issue to MotorWorks BMW in Minneapolis; where I bought the vehicle. They made the problem so much worse. The following week I took the vehicle to Bergstrom BMW in Appleton. They were able to locate and fix the problem. : Rattling noise coming from the back trunk area.


OMG - Sunroof UNUSABLE at any speed past 45!!! Makes a horrible thwawking sound that hurts everyone's ears!! Gets even worse if the sunroof is fully extended back! Very disappointing!!! Was excited by the large sunroof - but can't use it unless windows are open too!
Steering wheel to thick for my hands - they cramp up after gripping for extended period of time - has never happened on any other vehicle i have driven!
We can not get the voice recognition to work.  Mishears just about everything.  If we say Martin Street; it hears Michigan!  If we say Raleigh; it hears Wisconsin! VERY frustrating!!!  Also; the system is very difficult to use. Even after a Genius appointment and reading the directions; we still can't quite figure the system out and use our iPhones more often than not because we just give up with the BMW!
It is rather frustrating that the windows fog up so easily and often. Does require that the defogger go on during times you would not expect to have to use it.

The doors make a terrible rattle and seem to slam loudly when shut.  At one point the windows also made an ominous sound when going up and down; but that seems to have stopped for now. There is also some sort of screw or small item that rolls around somewhere inside the metal part of my trunk.  I haven't had time to take it in; but very annoying to hear it switch sides every time I make a turn!
I noticed after 1 month a discoloration on my drivers seat. It is slightly blue tint to it.  It is from my jeans rubbing off on the material.   I probably wore jeans 2-3 times in the car before I noticed this.   I now have to put a towel down before I sit in the drivers seat when wearing my jeans.
There is difficulty when accepting calls when bluetooth is connected.  There is either a delay in the actual ability to speak to the party calling; or the person calling cannot hear the passengers at all and they disconnect the call.
switch is on the side of the steering column and not visible - no way to know when the system is on
I can't charge my iPad because it is not a compatible port with Apply products.... Everyone uses Apple products. This should not be an issue.
The headrest will move up and down but it does not go all the way down like the passenger seat headrest.
Doesn't recognize commands
It does not work. I give up using it. I use my iPhone to search contacts now.
not sure where to gauage the obstruction
Wont connect the way it needs too
Seats dont respond the way they should
The rear knobs have fallen off over and over
THE BMW EMBLEMS HAVE COME OFF.  STICKER IS CHEAP AND NOT FIRM ON THE MAT
Just surprised to know the noise was coming from my new car.
: The self parking is easily engaged in the middle console area.  Brushing against it engages this feature.
The car and surrounding area should be completely quiet for proper recognition.
: The heated seats get too hot.  I think all BMWs are like this.
especially in cold weather
Difficult to use if not familiar with symbols

couldn't control the heat/ac from the control panel only went to rear control other functions weren't lit up; so unable to operate.
can't control temp.

Constantly brings up the incorrect name.  The name it brings up is not closely related to what I have said.

DOORS WILL ALWAYS OPEN WHEN I HAVE KEY ON ME; BUT I HAVE TROUBLE GETTING CAR TO LOCK WHEN I GET OUT BY HOLDING THE HANDLE.
WE CAN'T GET THE HEADRESTS TO COME OF
way to hot!!
: Have to fiddle with the bluetooth quite a bit sometimes to make it play what is on my phone.  Also my current ipod does not really work with the car
Carpet is beige in color and picks up soil from shoes easily.
: The sequence of events needed to switch fron front to rear camera and to side cameras is very confusing. Use of the system seems to be governed by a manual button; unless the car is in reverse and then put in forward. Example; when the car is in drive and you pull up to a wall the camera does not work until a button is pushed
The commands are not understood. To be fair the radio does find stations; At all times means that sometimes it work; sometimes not
The system send me on routesthat are incorrectI know this because I have checked it against areas that I am familiar with. On a recent 200 mile trip the system directed me to routes that did not agree with street signs. My previous car; an Audi; had a sustem that worked well.
This question is partially answered in the previous one. The second row seats are not as comfortable on trips. The slide back and forth has a limited movement Foot room is limited on middle seats; and the seats cannot fold flat due to the headrests hitting the front seats. The problem is not one that can be fixed by the dealer it is a design matter. They could not fix that.
The third row seats are folded most of the time. However when more room is needed; IE: the middle seats are folded down; there is not enough space for the second row to go flad. The head rests on the center seats bump against the front seats. SUGGESTION: look at the Volvo XC90; when the middle seats are folded down; there is a pull strap that folds the head rests down allowing for a flat surface. : The only other problem is the limited 3rd row seat room. That is not a major problem as those seats are not used much; and only for short trips. Again a design problem; not one that the dealer can fix
They are purely decorative. Pants or leg gets snagged when exiting.
: Bad parking brake module.
Does not understand streets and addresses.
The running boards are at the same height as the interior floor; making them awkward to use.
I have no idea how to adjust the steering wheel position; not intuitive.
It just takes time to get acclimated to the pace you need to speak and annunciation.
I cannot make position of the seat lower without the seat also going back further putting me too far from the steering wheel.
Carpet is NOT easy to clean and even the pro car wash can't get the mats clean.

WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE THEM AT ALL BECAUSE THEY GET PANTS DIRTY WHEN EXITING THE VEHICLE.  ESPECIALLY A PROBLEM FOR MY WIFE WHO IS SHORTER THAN I AM.
I was driving down a moderate hill at about 20 miles per hour and had to break hard on the breaks.  They were slower than my old X5 to stop the vehicle and it felt like the car just kept going.
: When you begin to drive the car locks all the doors.  This makes it difficult to open the rear hatch sometimes when I have only driven a short distance.
When playing radio or on navigation there is no 'cd' button near the jog dial so trying to switch over to CD is hard to do.

Says it is connected to my friends iPhone in the car and wont play his music.  It did at first but then the next time it said 'connected' but nothing.  Occasionally has dropped my iPhone out of Bluetooth connectivity.
The rear seats when folded down are hard to and require a 2 step process to raise back up.  They are confusing to operate.
: The seat belts for the third row seating are placed in such a way that closing the privacy cover in the rear when the third row seats are not up is cumbersome.  It catches on the seatbelts 100% of the time and makes this operation difficult and frustrating.  The interior of this car is cheap in comparison to every other  BMW I have owned.
This only happens when it is in that fuel consumption  mode.  The car jitters when the engine shuts down.
I believe this is from the climate control and only happens when the car is stopped and turned off.
It seems like they are too narrow; but make it difficult to get out of the car without getting the back of your calves dirty

it seems farther back then my previous x5 i have to climb in to install or take out the cover


Not intuitive and not clear what you are doing
The turn signal needs some getting used to it since it doesn't stay down or up - you are not sure if it is working
They should put the indicator further out in the mirror to easily see and make lot more prominent. I have another care with the indicator that goes from yellow to red and is located in the furthest point in the mirror.  I also don't like the location of the indicator which is not in the mirror itself.


It seems a little awkward getting in and out of car.

Noticed the day after delivery.  Dealership try to buff it out with no success.  Then; during the first week of ownership we received 3 cracks in the windshield.

Drops connection to bluetooth audio.  Occasionally shows phone connected and dialing but there is no audio.
Use of the BMW app is cumbersome; clumsy; redundant; unreliable and buggy.
I press the button.  Nothing happens.  It is as though there is no support or that whatever 'pumps up' has become disconnected.
: When it is on Auto the fan speed and AC engagement doesn't seem to change to maintain the temperature.

DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE SPELLING NUMBER
THE PAIRING IS DISC-ACTING SOME TIMES
The hatch doesn't automatically open all they way even though it does sometimes.  hard to figure out why but sometimes you need to open it manually all the way.
The sensors on the doors are not always easy to use.  Sometimes it takes me several attempts to open the door.
When you put your drink ; because of the angle of the cup holders; the drinks spill.
The floor mat slides a bit as I put pressure on it when exiting the car. The problem is very minor; but I do have to realign it upon entering the vehicle again.
a lot of wrong addresses given as choice and are not correct addresses or state : i use the voice system and it has a hard time with a lot of the addresses giving back correct information
SO MANY BUTTONS TO PUSH AND HARD TO FIND THE ONE FOR THE LUMBAR SUPPORT
I AM A SHORT PERSON SO HEADREST IS WAY ABOVE MY HEAD
SEEMS LIKE IT IS HARD TO LINE UP AND CONNECT
IF YOU HAVE ANY OIL OR LOTION ON YOUR BODY IT MAKES SOIL MARKS ON THE LEATHER.  ALSO SCUFFS EASILY.  SMUDGES EASILY.

Does not occur all the time
Not sure how to operate
The color from my pants rubs off on this particular car seat. My previous  2014 BMW which was the same color  did not have that issue.
Happens intermittently.
The female part should be longer.  It should be at least three inches longer.
: When I use windshield washer solution it smells very strongly inside vehicle


Back seat release does not work easily for my 8 year old and 6 year old to release or to buckle seems a little stuck.
The phone system is hit or miss in understanding names.  It seems to be more problematic than my 2008 X5 phone system.
Not very intuitive and sometimes struggles with voice commands. Also; entry of voice commands is not the same as the visual address entry prompts showing on the screen during voice entry.
After the 4rth month; the driver side fog light failed.

: Not really a problem; more of a driver preference issue.  Past BMW's I have owned have always had a somewhat firm steering feeling.  Obviously; power steering; but with a good feel of the road -- not too loose or easy to steer.  This vehicle provides that feeling; but only in sport mode.  When in comfort mode; I feel the steering doesn't provide a good feeling of the road; particularly when driving at high speed -- feels too easy to turn the wheel.  And; when in sport mode; the transmission never shifts into the highest gear; so it is impractical to keep it in sport mode to get the right steering feel because doing so sacrifices fuel economy.

When the cruise is started; the minimum distance setting is always starts with the max distance. I prefer the previous setting is stored and restored as it reflects the ability and the expectations of the driver. Since it always starts with max distance; many times the vehicle starts slowing down when cruise is set when the vehicle is at a manageable distance that driver perceives.
Indicator is hard to see if snow accumulates or not cleared fully. It should have been located inside.
The failure may be my pronouncing related. But my previous vehicle did a good job. Also my voice commands are well recognized on my smartphone. So I assume the voice recognition in this vehicle needs a good improvement.
Controls located at the side of the seat is not readily visible and hence prone to press wrong button. And 'one-press' operation is possible only when the door is open. Once door is closed; the memory recall button has to be kept pressing till it reached the stored position. Also seat doesn't move to stored position automatically when the engine is started; like the steering position.
During rain or snow times; it takes pretty long time to see the effect. In my previous vehicles this was pretty quick and I see the melted lines along the heating element lines fast. The same thing is observed for the side mirrors also.



gets dirty easely



STEERING WHEEL IS BLACK. HOW DO YOU SEE THE CONTROLS ON IT IN THE NIGHT DRIVING. TEH LIGHTS ARE HARD TOFIND AT NIGHT OR IN THE EVENING.
I cannot be certain that it was there day 1 but as I purchased a paint and interior protector that was applied the day I took the car home; I find it hard to believe that it could be otherwise. Not sure how to handle with dealership.

System rebooted 3 times already
System refused to come one and came on only 15 mins after driving
Click were emergency button section is. Will bring to dealer shortly. Just did not have time yet.
The operator manual is confusing. Operating the system is confusing.
small area of contact on rear hatch and requires more finger strength that I think it should. my mother's honda requires less than bmw. This is not faulty just difficult to manage
It's very touchy.  The slightest movement on the steering wheel turns the car;
They nice to look stand are cosmetic but they hit the back of your calf muscles.  My wife and I included.  You have to slide over to get out and step over to get in.
Easy to bump the gear shifter from Drive to neutral.
LOCK IN MECHANISM DOESN'T SEEM TIME ALLOWING A SMALL AMOUNT OF PLAY IN THE CONNECTIONS

Auto time zone adjustment doesn't work
difficult to preset selected radio stations
difficult to understand & manual not a lot of help.  After a lot of use; now have basic feature down but still not comfortable
some destinations don't select the best route
Sometimes it just keeps beeping for no reason.
when traveling long distance on the highway; the sound underneath seems extra loud; also when gravel changes occur it's noticed.  was the same with the 2013 X5 previously leased.
: Soon after the dealership installed the running board; I discovered streaks of glue  on the doors on both sides.
We have leased many BMW's over the years and they are always tight steering wheels which we like.  This is the first time that the car seems loose
Looks like the map is not updated for new streets about a year old
The seats are a light colored leather.


: the car does not recognize the name of the street ; etc. Keeps asking me a different names- very aggravating.
When typing info as the address shall be; the navigation system does not recognize the street. For example; typing N. State; will not recognize North and gives immediately North Ave
The windshield window does not have UV screen protection; at least at the top of the window. It is hard to drive during a sunny day.Our previous 2012 BMW X5 had it and it was very pleasant.
Tough to input points of interest. Also hard to recover inputting an address if not recognized the first time.
often gets stuck between sending sound through phone versus sending sound through Bluetooth speaker. Sometimes can't switch between iphone/Bluetooth. Need to turn off Bluetooth for phone calls to work when this happens. Might be related to when I have been listing to music via Bluetooth ; then try a phone call.
: the vehicle is very slow to warm up and provide heat to the interior
the release button does not operate smoothly
The carpet easily attracts dirt






Sunglass holder does not open easily when pressing the button
The special leather stains very easily;. Some marks can not be removed. Dealer is to redie the passenger seat : Seating is great; but problem is with the leather staining. Dealer is to redye the passenger seat



too lite in color
carpet area should have been a dark color.
speaker sounds like its blown out.  i do not play my music very loud; and there has not been any water/liquid damage; so am not sure how/why this happened.  however; this is covered under warranty so they will fix it.  I have an upcoming appointment with the dealer to have it serviced
Rear side vents blow out cold air; even when set on high eat.  Center rear console blows out hot air.  Taken to dealer; and they said this is normal .  Makes no sense.
on the edge of the passenger door; there was an un even area.
Although the rear entertainment system can be chosen to equally controlled from front or back; a lot of time it actually can only be accessed from back using the remote control. I have to get out of the car; go to the back and do it. Not very convenient.
: stinky smells coming from the AC after only owning the car for 2 months.
Hits back of leg when getting out.
Whenever I try to use voice command to enter the address; the system never gets it right. There is also frequent problems with using the phone book with voice command however usually the bane I wasn't is in the alternate provided names.
The main problem with the phone is when trying to use Pandora or music from my phone. I frequently have to press play on my phone. The rolling wheel on my steering wheel does not advance the music. I have to use the control to the right on the console.

WHEN I GET A VOICE MAIL IT ASKS ME IF I WANT TO READ IT OR IGNORE AND I HAVE TO REPEAT IGNORE A NUMBER OF TIMES
difficult to see because of steering wheel
difficult to see because steering wheel blocks it and there is no dashboard light signaling whether it is on or off
Light color shows dirt easily.
Shuts down when sitting at traffic light. Should wait at least 3 to 5 minutes before activating
Aluminum trim on center console scuffs around cup holders and on the interior of front doors.
Takes several pushes to get it to work.
It works sometimes; but not always.  Sometimes I have the fob right next to the door and it won't unlock with the button or by pulling on the handle.  I have to click the fob.  One time the alarm went off when doing so.  Definitely some issues.

It is so sensitive; it gets annoying and you start to ignore the vibrations...exactly the opposite of what the system is meant to do.




Memory buttons are at the side of the seat and you can't easily trace them without looking at it.
: AUTOMATIC CARWASH CAUSES FUEL DOOR TO OPEN; FUEL DOOR DOES NOT LOCK WHEN DOORS ARE LOCKED
MY SHOE SIZE IS US 11.5; SEVERAL TIMES MY  FOOT HAS CAUGHT ON THE BRAKE PEDAL CAUSING ME TO POULL IT RATHER THAN PUSH IT.
TRUNK/HATCH OPENS ON ITS OWN : KEY IS DIFFICULT TO CARRY IN POCKET OR PURSE/HANDBAG; SUBTLE OR UNINTENTIONAL CONTACT WITH KEY FROM CONTENTS OF A PURSE; OR FROM REACHING IN A POCKET; WILL CAUSE WINDOWS TO OPEN OR TRUCK TO OPEN.
ANTHRACITE HEADLINER SCRATCHES FROM VERY LITTLE PRESSURE--A FINGERNAIL WILL EASILY SCRATCH THE HEADLINER; CARGO COVER EASILY SCRATCHES ANTHRACITE HEADLINER.
Doesn't recognize names in my contacts even when I try very hard to enunciate the person's name that I am attempting to call.
: The seat belt buckle on the passenger side rubs against the interior door panel when not in use causing an irritating rattling noise.
the display that shows eco-pro; fuel consumption and the compass went out twice and i couldn't file through or see the display. Upon restarting the car; the display began working again. It hasn't happened in about a month.
I don't like that one has to continuously hold the button to close the hatch.  Opening the hatch is easy just one push of the button; and not a continuous hold.
I have to tap it more than once for it to open.  It gets annoying.  Also; when closing it needs a rough tap; not an easy close.

There is a new compartment to hold sunglasses that is a great idea.  However; the compartment is too small to hold a nice pair of women's sunglasses.
Cup holders are on a slant and difficult to use.  If drink does not have a cover I worry kids will spill the contents or if I go over a bump that can cause a spill due to the slant.  In my older version of the X% cup holders were in the middle section.  The middle seat had to pulled down and cup holders were there.  While the cup holders were better in the older version; it is important to note that the only way to use them is if the middle seat was not needed.

Every time I drive under a freeway/tunnel/parking garage I lose complete satellite radio reception.
The aux port is located inside the storage box in-between the driver and front passenger seats.  I mostly use the aux port to connect to my cell phone which I have lots of music stored on or I may be streaming music from an app on my cell phone.  I prefer to have my cell phone out so that I can see it and so the aux cord sticks out of the storage box and I cannot completely close the storage box while using the aux cord.
The heated seat on the passenger side gets hot quickly but does not maintain the heat when on the highest setting.

switches from speakers to phone and then back again

As the car was bought during winter; before picking it up a set of Winter wheels was bought and replaced. The All-season wheel were kept at BMW Dealer storage. In summer; when going there to change the wheels; one was chipped and other had scratches. Dealer scheduled to repair it next week.
Excessive heating independently of the temperature that was set
Even setting to cool; it got hot
Sometimes it doesn't understand me
Often drops calls and then reconnects
Keyless entry does not work sometimes.
I have no idea why it does not work sometimes it's totally random.
Even following the Manual this navigation system is very hard to use.  Hard to program address in address book and change views of navigation.
Some areas have the thin paint or uneven paint. Some areas show the uneven color; for example; rear bumper and skirt. Insides the tailgate; lift up; the paint covered under the tailgate is also uneven.
The passenger side wiper usually leaves the smearing mark in the 50% of coverage; especially during the snowing days. Sometimes it happens in rainy days; too. It seems the wiper arm doesn't press the enough pressure in the middle of wiper; or the wiper blade isn't able to stick with windshield to clean the snow/water.

entering number of street; name; city
Many repeats needed
: Collision sensor dirty; not activated
When accessing people to call

Rear hatch does not open with hands-free mode (kick under bumper. it initially worked 5 or 6 times; then it needed 3-4 attempts to work; then it stopped working. The trunk hatch opens fine with key and hand latch though

Engine sputters when start immediately after turning engine off.  also at a cold start and sometimes when idling.  This is embarrassing.
: front windshield wiper - when held fully away from windowshiled to wash; the arm hits the paint on the edge of the hood.  Over time will chip paint.
: My phone will not allow voice control; lowest level android from ATT.  Will upgrade my phone and pair up; with dealership's rep'; assistance.
: I don't know that this is a problem but it seems that the side vents do not put out much air when the air conditioner is on.  I went to the dealer and he said he guesses that is the way it is designed pretty poor design because not much comes out on the side and that is not good
I AM PETITE PERSON AND NEED THE SIDEBAR ADJUSTMENT YOU USED TO SUPPLY. RIGHT NOW IF I HAVE AN ACCIDENT; THE STRAP WILL BREAK MY NECK!!!!  NOT TAKEN TO DEALER BECAUSE I THINK IT CANNOT BE REPAIRED. : ITS NOT THE SEAT!!!!!    ITS THE SEAT BELT!!!!
SOMETIMES DRINKS INTERFERE /MEDIA OPERATION; AND WITH PHONE CHARGER. CANS AND BOTTLES FIR BEDT; BUT I NEED TYHE INSULATION OF A MUG OR KUZZY.
: SOMETIMES; I CANNOT GET THE CAR IN GEAR. IT'S ERRATIC; BUT INVARIBLY HAPPENS IN  HEAVY TRAFFIC; AS IN THE TRAFFIC LIGHT TURRING TO GREEN.
I was disappointed soft close option was not offered.
FIRST TWO TIME THE SENSOR SAID TIRE HAD LOW PRESSURE;It was ni9ght so I had to find a gas station that had air; find the right amount of money for the air and luckily my husband was there. I have no idea how to put in air. This happened 2 times and finally the dealer decided I had a slow leak in my tire. SO I purchased a new tire. Then last week it said lowtire pressure car went back into nBMW and this time it was a sensor
this is especially a problem when I ask for a number or phone book name




i have a computer malfunction that locked up the steering which was very dangerous
computer malfunction
engine locked up because of comupter malfunciton
Blemish appears to be excess glue where the glass is attached to the vehicle.
Exhaust pipes have staining
Confusing controls.  In addition; wipers must be turned on again and reset each time car is turned off.
Must turn on signals twice to keep on.

black paint on plastic is slightly different shade than the black paint on the metal parts - only noticeable in bright sunlight
There is a media auxiliary port in the console that does not work with my audio device.  The USB port that is in the arm rest does not work with my audio device either.
Sometimes it connects.  Sometimes I have to restart my phone; remove the pairing and reconnect it.  Seems to happen at the most inopportune times.
Some cups/containers do not fit well due to the cover that can be placed over the holders when not in use.  The ones in the doors appear to only be good for a plastic bottle with a cap.

The hatch open button located in the license plate area only works when both doors are unlocked; this feature is very inconvenient; and unsafe because if you are only able to watch the driver side while you are loading the hatch; someone could enter your passenger door. Also on the key remote the trunk botton is very difficult to use.
The key fob button does not alway engage.
It seems like you can everytime your tires touch the road.
Maybe the gas padal should be designed at an angle in the natural rest position of the right foot; with a little more space between the two padals.
It takes too much force to make the horn sound off.
The audible indicator sensors are too sensitive to cold. There is noway of shutting off the sensors permanetly until the ice can be removed from them. There is a button that only shut the sound off until you make a complete stop; and then it's back on again. This is very annoying; esspecally if you have a long ride in bumper to bumper traffic.
There should be at least two usb ports; and one that not tucked in the arm rest; but visiable to the driver.
The butons should be positioned on the driver's door arm rest.
Will not stop at middle stop.
Hard to find and hard to pull.

Although it may be a problem in Hawaii; it does not take our street address.  There is no 'Home' that I can find
doesn't recognize names of roads in the Cincinnati area
Doesn't recognize streets in the Cincinnati area - way too many steps involved when entering a manual address for navigation
When travelling at highway speeds; the road and wind noise is noticeable.  This is especially noticeable when in highway traffic with other vehicles around.
The vehicle came with summer tires; and these type of tires should not be OEM equipment in vehicles sold in the snowy Midwest. Or in the alternative; it should have been brought to my attention. The sales person worked with me to order winter tires and wheels; which was an unanticipated expense; but resolved the issue.
The buttons for the garage door opener are on the rear view mirror.  In my past BMW X5 those controls were not on the mirror; rather on the ceiling center control.  They were easier to reach there; the mirror is not as convenient.
The start button and the override switch is behind the steering wheel and is difficult to see. Which results in the override button being inadvertently activated/deactivated.
when stating cities it often times does not provide the correct options; and when repeated; it does not improve.
: The issue that is frustrating to me is the location and orientation of the seat buckle against the pillar when you reach to begin the buckling process.  The buckle is difficult to grasp; it lays flat against the plastic pillar and rather than being easily grabbed sometimes requires a turn around to grab it; it's annoying.  My X5 had a much more convenient buckle.
: The gas pedal alignment with the brake pedal is not the same so you have to lift your foot to shift from one to the other versus just sliding across.  Perhaps it's just the difference as compared to my previous vehicle but I sort of 'tripped' getting to the brake pedal until I acclimated.  It was scary.
Just seems really loud for a luxury vehicle











: Squeaking noises from inside the cabin when driving.  Seems to be coming from doors or somewhere in the interior.  Usage of the putting up the windshield wipers chipped the paint off from the hood.
: Creaking noises inside the cabin when driving.: Squeaking noises from inside the cabin when driving.  Seems to be coming from doors or somewhere in the interior.  Usage of the putting up the windshield wipers chipped the paint off from the hood.
Pedals are too close together for a size 10 mens shoe. My husband has to be very conscious where he places his shoes so that he does not press on both together.
Poorly designed option. The image is skewed to an angle and the adjustment range is too narrow to  fit my height so that the image is either cut-off at the bottom or obstructs my view of the road. I cannot find a good sweet spot where it is positioned correctly. My husband drives a 5-series with the same module and it is perfectly adjustable for both of us although we are a foot difference in height. Overall the build quality of the X-4 is poor compared to the 535 and other sedans.
the switch under the steering wheel is very hard to find. I spent 30 mins looking for it and had to look in the user manual to find it.
The instructions are hard to follow. Requires the driver to practice many times before they can use it effectively. I did not have the confidence to use it under a pressure situation where I had to parallel park with traffic behind me which was where I would most likely use. I don't think that I will be using the feature at all in the future.
Has multiple problems with IOS8 on the iphone 5/6. Have complained to the dealership but they keep saying it is an apple issue and not a BMW issue.
My husband is 5'11' and the seat does not go back far enough for him to be comfortable. He drives a 5-series and that adjusts perfectly.

: my bluetooth does not function in a manner that recognizes and displays the correct album/song choice at the right time. It doesn't read it or change when the song changes.

: passenger seat had small cut

I cannot trust the blind Indicator system. I ordered it specially be hace I had it in my old car a ford and it worked great . In this car it s not reliable!!!! I cannot trust it!!!! It s very bad
CaNnit make sens of it
: Blind spot not trust worthy ; radio cheap speakers and difficult to operate. Cheap seats no padding
The system is retarded and too slow
Cheap leather very thin. Not enough support
Blind spot not trust worthy ; radio cheap speakers and difficult to operate. Cheap seats no padding
Really have to slow car down to make a turn.
Doesn't respond well with voice commands when using phone and Bluetooth.  Constantly pairing phone and Bluetooth.
On several occasions gave command to contact in phone book did not recognize command requested
When accelerating after a complete stop the car hesitates somewhat until the gas pedal is pushed down harder.
Black get dirty fast and smell


I am not happy at all with x4 because black interior smell bad when is warm and get dirty fast in black.too small from 4 people


The trunk opens when you make a kicking motion under the bumper.  This works sporadically for me.
: Google maps is capable of sending directions to my car.  This feature doesn't seem to work.

JUST MISINTERPRETS COMMANDS
my salesman could not get it to work i dont know how.
Does not understand my commands
In a location hard to see if it is on or not
Can get uncomfortably hot at the seams
When opening and closing the door there was aloud squeaking noise
Dealer ordered part and had m bring the car back for service
Door hinge squeaks when opening and closing. Wd40 did not solve problem. Will take to dealer for problem.
Brakes fade under heavy use compared to our 3 series.
Displayed warning lines hard to understand; would like to see overhead view instead.

ticking noise around the front of the engine.
THE FUEL CAP opens on its own.
there is noise around the windows when traveling on the highway. around the driver door there is a loud popping noise.
loud; can hear the road
the car feels all the bumps in the road and jumps around
it does not recognize voice commands for address
The navigation system does not respond to voice command. I always have to physically put in the address. So agrivating.
the door itself makes a loud crack noise; like something is breaking
it is unplesant. not a new car smell
We picked our new bmw x4 up from the woodlands store in houston Tx it was at night the next day we discovered paint chip and door ding. The dealership made the repAires but it took a long time to get it right. For the file our salesman was really good and did all he Could to fix the problem


ON the GPS Screen the car's speed is not shown; nor is the speed limit for the current stretch of the road .
A few times the GPS had us in the woods and not on the road.  Had to zoom in significantly to fix the problem.
Consumes gas a t a much faster rate than expected based on the specs.  Highway  and City are much lower than expected.
Had to call Roadside Assistance to jump start the car within first two weeks of ownership.  Since then not a problem.
: Actual fuel economy doesn't go up to what is indicated in manual or advertisement.













Brake system seems to be under-sized
The steering system seems to want to move in the right  direction
Width of seat is very narrow
Too small
Too small
Too small
Dashboard must be cleaned with windex because soils easily.

sometimes does not open completely
door trim not aligning

difficult to program
Trim is coming loose and I plan to take it to the dealer. I just haven't gotten around to it yet.



: DOM'T PAIR SOMETIME
I had difficulty with my phone not pairing and it would disconnect me and the radio would come on instead . This issue has since been resolved by resetting
I have Burnt  orange seats which stain if wearing dark blue jeans
: Foot well is very cramped and pedals are too close together
power plug is inside the center console




dashboard is easily soiled; foot wells soil easy and allow water to be trapped in the gaps
Automatic lift arm does not always fully open the hatch : The automatic lift arm on the hatchback fails to automatically lift the hatch sometimes. The hatch will open some but you must then push the hatch up manually.
It does not get street names correct and should have a feature to keep the city & state you are in as a default without requiring you to reenter each time!
I frequent drop calls due to bluetooth connectivity between my iPhone 6 and the car.

The wood like material on the center console between the two front seats scratches extremely easily!
shoes commonly scuff the door sills when exiting the vehicle; but it is easily fixable with some mothers leather cleaner
System seems inconsistent. Sometimes it displays and other times does not. Have had vehicles pull in front of me that causes me to brake. Other times when the setting is set for shorter distance the warning light again; does not illuminate. There are times coming into traffic the light comes on as I apply the brakes. Maybe I misunderstood but I thought in extreme cases the 'collision avoidance' would assist in slowing down the vehicle; but it does not.
: For the money spent on the upgraded speaker system sounds no different than the standard stereo system that is factory installed. Would not recommend.

the area to keep your key is not in a convenient place and I often 'forget' to take the key until I am out of the car - new habit. Also; I keep other things in that storage area and often they are picked up inadvertently as well as the key.
I frequently hit the button to deactivate the quiet car at a traffic light system while I am trying to push the button for the ignition.  Also; the key 'holder' is not in a convenient place and I forget it or pick up other things that are there.
there is a slight chip in the passenger side glass
Appears to be scratch from tie-down on car transport.
iPhone 6 connectivity via Bluetooth is terrible. There is no excuse for BMW to ship a new vehicle with these problems.



: The rear seat does not have enough leg room.  We did not get a third row and the option to get more 2nd seat leg room would have been a big plus for a luxury SAV
Insufficient lighting inside the vehicle cabin.  Recommend additional lighting.
docking station is takes up valuable room and is not needed. Cannot remove. Would like to remove
Cannot understand how to turn the radio off.  Instead; I have to mute the sound.
For several routes that I am very familiar with and where I know the best route; the BMW nav system gives me a different route that is clearly less efficient.  For example; despite setting the nav system to 'maximize freeways'; it will move off the freeway and take a different route just because this alternate route is a mile or so less than the 'maximize freeways' route; even though it would take much longer.
IT SEEMS LIKE THE WINDSHIELD IS SPLIT IN TWO BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARK
IT IS DIFFICULT TO USE THIS PORT WHILE DRIVING.  IT IS HARD TO SEE IT AND WORK IT IN EVEN WHEN NOT DRIVING AND THERE ARE TOO FEW PORTS TO RUN VARIOUS ELECTRONICS.
IT DOES NOT SEEM TO RECOGNIZE MY VOICE AND GIVES ME THE WRONG RESPONSES TO MY REQUESTS
IT IS HARD FOR ME TO MAKE THIS ADJUSTMENT
IT IS DIFFICULT TO TURN IT OFF BECAUSE IT TAKES TOO MANY STEPS
I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THE HEATER TO WORK UNLESS I TURN IT ON VERY HIGH  AND I MAY JUST BE DOING IT WRONG; WILL TAKE TO THE DEALER
This is the same lamp mentioned previously. Rear passenger floor courtesy lamp not working. : floor courtesy lamp under second row passenger seat is not working
Plastic used for cargo floor latch marred when sliding equipment in and out of vehicle.
I have the beige interior that stains easily. When I wear blue jeans the color transfers to the leather. I tried cleaning it with the leather cleaner that came with the car but it did not do make much of a difference.
There is noise from the right passenger side; probably from the window.  We did a road trip this weekend for the first time and noticed the sound.  It's faint but definitely present
It doesn't recognize some street names; and the ones it offers as possibilities are far-fetched
It will just randomly claim my phone isn't paired.
: Windshield fluid sprayer was operating at least optimial performance. It had to be replaced. One of the three total on the front windshield.
doesn't seem to cool down unless setting is below 70


It is noisy compared to my wife's sedan.  I think it is an inherent issue with SUVs and not necessarily a problem
The restart takes a fraction of a second longer than my wife's Mercedes C300.  It is not a problem; I just have adjust my driving style.
Difficult to understand; even when sitting in the seats; how the controls are actually chanding the lumbar support.
The phone cradle under the storage lid blocks half the storage area. You have to open the storage lid; then lift the cradle out of the way to get at whatever is in the storage area.  The USP and AUX ports also make it difficult to get at whatever is stored when the ports are in use.
You have to push on the gas pedal and get the engine revving before the vehicle actually moves - from a stop and when trying to accelerate .

Piece of the handle is loose not necessarily broken I can still open close door with out any issues
Rear bumper not centered
I have not taken a long road trip yet to see if the gas is excessive but going to and from work; which is a total of 40miles; I have noticed that the vehicle consumes gas much faster than what I think is normal. My previous SUV; Toyota Landcruiser; didn't consume as much; in my opinion.
The snow is not melting fast in back window.
It has been difficult to understand the auto unlock / lock options when the key is nearby.  Also; when trying to open the hatchback without pressing the button on the remote key is awkward.
When using polarized sunglasses it is hard to see.  Also; the vertical positioning of the display is not high enough when the seat is lowered.  Also; changing drivers between my spouse and I one of us is 6' and the other is 5'4' thus getting the heads up display to be at the right height has been a challenge.

On occasion right after starting the vehicle there is an unpleasant odor that we experience for about 5 minutes and then it goes away.
Point of reference is to a 2014 BMW M5... the steering here is much looser
Probably a function of the light color


Steering wheel does not go down far enough. : No further adjustment.
The on/off switch is only in the backseat and cannot be controlled from the front seat.  Also the rear controls cannot be controlled by the driver ie when you have a young child not old enough to manipulate the controls it makes it hard for the driver to do so.

from ski rack when rubber gaskets not installed
: speaker volume very low with Bluetooth   Volume with Radio and connected device OK

It is just something that I have learned to do with and I put the car in sport mode when driving at all times to resolve the problem.
I can barely see the little triangle.  I do not hear any sound.  I previously had Lexus RX - the bsm was better.
It's difficult to call someone - displays too many choices from contact list




Compare to a Lexus which has a smooth steering control when driving on a straight path especially on freeways; the BMW X5 seems jumpy or needs more control when driving on straight path.  However; X5 has great mobility when turning or at sharp curbs.
The rear indicator sensor sometimes turn on even when there's no visible obstruction or objects on rear view camera or even when I look behind the rear.  It turns on for 5 seconds and then off.  Happened a few times.

Always had to push MAX AC to achieve desired cool temperature.
Glove compartment was replaced.
It was noticed the morning after delivery.  Light scratches that could be felt with a fingernail -- the BMW Service manager said; 'snow brush'; when I showed them to him.
MOTOR APPARENTLY STOPPED WORKING
Doesn't happen consistently; periodically it locks up.
defective; developed flat spot sitting on lot that would not round out; all tires replaced at 650 miles
Rims are B7 and thin so bend very easy
: Cold air seems to come from the lower center area      unless the temp is turned higher than we would normally turn temp in a vehicle
auto feature of passing foot under bottom of car does not work for me yet works when at dealer
Suspension makes noise when going over speed bumps at any speed....  Just in the front

All wood scuffs very easily
Is mainly when driving .

I keep getting out and reclosing the door ; but it doesn't make a difference. The noise is very distracting .
I cleanned back seats myself and I was surprised that stain did not come out as expected.
Indicator lighting could be brighter or flash to attract attention. The lighting as it is now seems to blend in with the side view mirror. Sometimes; the warning light is on and I don't see it unless I am actively looking for it.
On certain phones; the paired phone will disconnect randomly and will not reconnect until Bluetooth service is restarted on phone. Email and text messages are not updated to the system in real time...there is a 10 minute delay
: Driver seat does not go high enough for my height. It is designed that way but it is not comfortable for me or people under six feet. I wish the seat could go up another inch or so.
it is very hard to operate the trunk- it gets stuck and doesn't want to open.
its a weird dent there. like it was scraped on  a truck
with every vehicle the tire pressure sensor is to sensitive
the plug does not allow for charing of cell phone. doesn't work.
I just don't understand how to work it
trying to understand how to work them
they don't appear to be working


I can hear traffic and wind noise coming from the general vicinity of the rear passenger-side of the vehicle. I didn't notice the noise on the test drive. In fact; I was amazed at how quiet it was; for a convertible. However; after lowering and raising the roof a few times; it almost sounds as though it's no longer 'sealed'.

It doesn't misunderstand me all the time and the problem is not related to any certain circumstance. Occasionally; I will tell the car to 'Call ______' and it will ask me if I want to search connected media or playlists - like it thinks I want it to play a song.
Yesterday; it sent me to a POI that went out of business 2 years ago. Other times; it has not recognized that a road has been re-routed.
I have tugged and tugged and can't get the backseat middle armrest/ski pass-thru to fold down.
My driver's seat is stained from driving it while wearing blue jeans.
Unlike Lexus; the BMW side mirrors do not automatically fold when the car is locked.
After driving my wife's Lexus with parking assist which has easy to understand displays and audible warnings; I find the displays in the BMW hard to understand and difficult to tell the distance from the bumper to the obstacle.  To make matters worse; the BMW parking assist will automatically switch on when the car is placed in reverse but does not switch on when the car is driven forward into a garage or parking place. Since the Lexus system is on all the time; it is dangerous that the BMW system is not and has to be manually turned on.
After driving my wife's Lexus with blind spot monitoring which is bright; located on the mirror itself; and works to 0 MPH; I am VERY disappointed with the BMW system. The indicator light is not bright enough. The system does not work below -20-30 MPH. This is very dangerous since Lexus works at all speeds and moving from Lexus to BMW can cause me to think that the blind spot is clear changing lanes in rush hour traffic when it is not. The location of the light on the side of the mirror and its dimness are also problems especially in daylight.
I purchased the BMW individual Interior at almost $5000 additional cost. After less than 1000 miles the surface of the driver's seat bolster began to peel off. Within 3 months of purchase a large area of the bolster had peeled away. When I took the car back to the dealer and complained; a slow; difficult process has begun to get the seat replaced. BMW estimates this will take 3 months. No one at BMW seems to upset about this defect. It is difficult to get timely updates on the progress of the repair. As a former long time Lexus owner; I am extremely disappointed with the quality of the leather and the customer service I have gotten so far from BMW. : I purchased the BMW individual Interior at almost $5000 additional cost.

usb plug in console difficul to see
easily subject to damage from potholes
MOST CARS HAVE AUTO BUTTON TO OPEN AND CLOSE TRUNK OR REAR GATE.  OPENING AND CLOSING THE TRUCK IS THE MAIN; PROBABLY ONLY; THING THAT I COMPLAIN ABOUT ON THIS CAR.  I LOVE IT; BUT LIFTING THE TRUNK TOP IS HEAVY AND DIFFICULT.  THIS ID OUR SECOND 650i  IT'S NOT BROKEN...JUST TOO HEAVY TO MANNUALLY LIFT UP
: Does not properly finish ripping the entire CD's to built-in hard drive


Dealer is still addressing this matter.
The seats do not cool much.
Everything slides around in teh center console.
Have not yet asked dealer to address this matter. I believe that it is lessening as I drive the car.
M' package has lower front grills that cover air intake. The passenger side lower grill fell off shortly after delivery. When I bought a replacement; I could not believe how such a well made expensive vehicle could be made with plastic grills that snap on. Very flimsy and expensive junk! I went to dealer who then referred me to their parts depth who told me the part was over $65.00 so I went to a small body shop that ordered it for me for $30.00! I cannot get over how the dealer was charging me full retail for a vehicle I just picked up. : Nothing but the front passenger grill. I assume I will have these grills falling off often since its such junk
when speaking to 'call' someone on bluetooth system; unit sometimes switches automatically to naviagtion system with maps or an unknown city
car's message system calls BMW dealer to randomly schedule appoitments
songs played from iPhone via Bluetooth skip intermittently with apparent connection problems

The front driver seat squeaks and creeks during normal driving conditions at any speed

Blue Jean color is bleeding onto the seats; seats also soil very easily

All the lighter surfaces are showing excessive wear and tear for a new vehicle; I have treated each area the day I bought the vehicle with Scotch Guard and other protective products to no avail.
If the seat is adjusted a certain way; it wont rattle.
Once in a while; the car revs by itself when I first turn on the engine
I had a driver restraint light come on and I heard click noise come from my steering wheel or the engine
It isn't necessarily a problem; they just feel overall underpowered for the weight of the vehicle. At this performance  level my expectation would be breaks to match the performance of everything else. However; I don't feel unsafe; but underwhelmed.
For a car of this price point; there should be an automatic trunk.
poor comfort access design.






: the passages front seat is making a moving / squeaking noise when i drive


It is not a problem to release the trunk latch; but there should be something on the remote to CLOSE the hatch.  When I come home with a load of groceries; I don't like to have to put them down in order to push the trunk closed.  It is hard to believe in a car of this price that it doesn't have a trunk close on the remote.
It is hard to unlock rear doors even after pushing the remote unlock 2 times.  I have to go stand next to the passenger rear door to unlock it.
The display only shows how many miles you have left on the tank .  I would like to see how many miles I have gone.  I don't like always having to push the button to make it appear.
It is difficult to change to presets on satellite when you are on fm and hard to change stations period.  My 2011 Mercedes E350 had a much more user-friendly system.  Friends with BMW all complain about this.
The seat belt cuts me in the neck.
I get only about 250 miles on a tank; which is less than my old BMW 545I; with a bigger engine.  If I had known just how bad it was; I wouldn't have bought this car.
Knocking under dash. Fixed on first visit
The USB port causes my iPhone to go through intermittent charging .  It renders my USB port useless to me.  I have an iPhone 6.
passenger seat rattles over even small bumps and rough road surfaces
There are two latches for the hood. One on the left and one on the right. You need to press down on the left side of the hood hard just above the latch under the hood for it to engage. It is not a big deal and I'm sure it could be easily adjusted.

When asking to navigate to an address it rarely manages to interpret it properly and for some reason defaults to addresses in Maine; even though I bought and use the vehicle in Pennsylvania

: WINDSHIELD SCRATCH
Am using a LG  4G LTE from Verizon; purchased Sept 2014 - Phone also pairs with Android Wear .  After much struggling; have removed the latter device from the phone.  Seems to have solved problem.  Didn't seem to have issue with previous 2012 BMW 528i during several weeks of use prior to vehicle change.
Phone pairs with car but audio does not stream.  If I reboot phone; will stream but if I turn off car and then on have to reboot the phone to get it to work again.
: Roof doesn't always close at first try.
BMW remote app does not work
System has difficulty recognizing any type of command. Must repeat all commands.
: I cannot open the trunk using my foot as was demonstrated.  Perhaps I am too short
I cannot figure out how to save addresses if they are not in the phone book.

when asked to called someone specific you are ask if you want to call someone different.
i think for a bmw the fan should not be that loud for heating or for a/c
it doesn't open all the way
We actually have two new cars; this one and a new Mercedes ML.  Both have the same problem in that we apparently don't speak proper english.  But then we have similar problems with our iPhones as well; just not quite as bad as the two cars.
Part failed - dealer replaced
Front door has problem opening like it feels like it gets stuck on a hook and does not want to open. Been having this problem since i bought the car.
noisy road noise from tires----changes with different road conditions and speeds
no keyless entry for rear doors.  need to unlock front doors before accessing rear doors keylessly. : the keyless entry doesn't work for the rear doors----only the front doors
speedometer should have digital option; as well as analogue gauge.  I don't have the heads up option; so no digital reading is provided for speed.

The main unlock/lock button for all the doors of the car; is located in an inconvenient place. It is in the center console underneath the emergency lights button. Not on the driver side door where it should be.
: Volume not loud enough. The range is not ample for those customers who wish to listen to their music at a loud volume.
Once you close the driver side door; you must press and HOLD the seat number memory button. This is very inconvenient. Other cars you just tap the button once instead of holding it down through the entire movement. I realize this is a safety feature but it is very inconvenient.
A small rock hit the windshield and it completely cracked from the left side all the way to the right. Very strange for a brand-new car to crack that wide.


Hatch should open with movement of foot under bumper. It usually does not work. Sometimes will work with many movements of foot under the bumber.
: The engine is very noisy at idle. Sounds like a old truck diesel engine.

The cup holder is below a removable tray.  The tray has no real place to go.  However there is a picture on the bottom of the tray that it supposed to show how to store it under the glove box; but I haven't figured out where it is supposed to go.  So basically I keep the cup holders covered up; and if there is no one else in the car and need the cup holder the tray sits on the front passenger seat until I am done with it.  I don't really use cup holders very often in my car; so it is not much of hassle.
Despite having all the nav system settings set for highway/fast travel; it tries to take me on local roads as 'shortcuts' to my destination. These routes are typically slow speed and have resulted in longer travel times.  I am very disappointed in this updated navigation system. Issues like the ones above never happened with my 2008 BMW 535xi. : None. Only the navigation decision making logic appears not to be fine tuned.
The leather seats on this car are beige and whenever I wear jeans; blue rubs off onto them. So there is a purplish color on the left side of the driver's seat.
Too small

The brake has a hold but it is very light.  When the car is put in park on a slant/hill; there is a long drop before the brake takes effect.  Also; very easy to initially drive off w/the brake on an not notice because the hold is so light.
The gas pedal is too close to the floor of the car.  My foot has to lay slanted w/my heel laying on the car floor.  This is damaging to my shoes; as well as creates on uncomfortable position for my foot/leg.
The back trunk lock sensor is too sensitive to your standing position.  Many times it does not open by kicking your leg forward under the tailgate.  Even sometimes w/moving your standing position. The rear seat locks always lock upon the driver exiting.  This is frustrating when I need to simply get something out of the back seat; but have to open the driver door again and push the unlock button on the middle console. I believe there is a program feature for this but I have not been able to find it.
The clock w/in the dashboard is too small and at an inconvenient location.  I have to lean up and look over the turning wheel to see the clock. You can program a clock on the video screen; but it doesn't stay permanently when you use other features. I would have appreciated a permanent clock on the middle console.
The ignition control button is fine. It is the Stop/Start button feature directly located above the ignition that is in a terrible location.  I hate the stop/start feature and it is to easy to hit this button when starting and stopping the car.  Many time I accidently hit the stop/start while quickly turning the car off; then not know the feature is on when I restart the car and drive.
I am the key driver and the system Has Frequent Pairing/Connectivity Issues w/my cell.  It seems to be stuck on my husbands phone.  It will not easily connect w/my phone and disconnect w/my husbands phone; even though my phone is the main connection. At one time I drove into my garage and the phone all of a sudden connected with my husbands cell phone conversation on my system.  He was inside my house using his phone.
Both the front and Back seat head rests are at a bad angle and do not adjust enough to be comfortable for me the drive nor my back seat passengers. The control is to small to find as the driver. You have to physically turn around to find it and make an adjustment.
I dont like the Automatic Climate Control.  The car heating/cooling system turns on automatically each time I initially start the car.  I have to always turn off the system upon starting the car.  Living the in the Pacific NW w/mild climate and parking inside you dont need automatic climate control.  I dont like the extra pull on the engine and systems when I am starting the car. The Climate Control Off button is weird.  It should just be an Off button; not the Fan Button.
I've had trouble with setting the memory function.
My seats are venetian beige leather.  The seats seem to be 'grabbing' any residue color from my clothing.  The surface has a lot of texture and looks as though it could be difficult to clean.
My interior is venetian beige and the carpet and door panels show dirt; scuffs; etc.
TPMS warning poped out once ; but there was nothing wrong with my tires in fact .
Bottles and big cups always have conflict with the dashboard
The button to unlock the doors is an inconvenient location .
Antiquated navigation system
The control is a four-way disc;  presumably up/down would raise/lower the lumbar and left/right would push it out/retract it; but it doesn't seem to work that way.  In other words; instructions aren't clear; and the physical feedback and movement of the actual lumbar doesn't seem to jibe with the lumbar control.
The 'check engine' light came on mysteriously.  After filling the gas tank for the first time; it went off ; so I presume it was a loose gas cap.
: Electrical functions in the rear half of the car failed. No signal lights; windows did not work; couldn't open trunk. It was determined that a control module for the rear half of the car had failed. Dealer obtained a replacement and corrected the problem.

basically just have to sit in the tan seats with your jeans on and they leave a soil mark on the seats
sometime the heater will 'turn off' and become very cold for a few minutes and then turn on again







Uncomfortable and looks 'cheesy'
: The iDrive in my vehicle became hard to turn 3 months after I got the car.
Would be very beneficial to have a USB port in a more convenient location; such as glove box.
: the controller failed and had to be replaced
: Piano black trim was scratched everywhere. Seems to be a reoccurring problem.
it kept losing air; and would end up flat.  Thank goodness I have a gas station 3 blocks away. and then paid to replace the tire


Generally; I see a city consumption of <20 mpg  even in limited traffic on streets with traffic lights. I always have the start stop option on so it should save gas further.
too loose
clock


grabbers broken
: When we purchased it there was a small tear in the back of the headrest if the driver side seat.
I don't know why the woodgrain area of the dash and console are scratch easily. I don't recall touching it with anything that would scratch it.
Noticed head light condensation upon delivery. Took vehicle back to dealer and was advised that it was 'normal'

did not understand how to raise/lower head rest.
: Heated seats get REALLY hot when on max setting.


The cup holder when using tall cups blocks the air conditioning controls
: Music hard drive won't combine multiple sets of music from a single thumb drive. Music winds up in separate folders and won't combine into base folder.  Music hard drive will not treat iPhone as a storage device.
Takes to wrong location; POIs are not current; Cannot find an accurate address
Memory seats only seem to remember last driver.  Seat memory is not connected to Driver 1 or Driver 2 key.
Only cools best wehn on MAX AC
Sorry; but haven't investigated thoroughly. Will take it to dealer soonest.
Would love to see the map and the written detailed streets instructions on the same screen. When staring at the map; sometimes it's hard to tell what street to turn on and whether or not it's the next street coming up. If on the detailed instruction sheet; we then can't see the map... Ideally if we need to make a turn coming up; the screen can split to show the written instruction  as well as the map itself on the other side of the screen. That would be much more helpful as sometimes I would miss a turn/exit if I wasn't sure if that was the street to turn on or the exit to take due to a long off ramp.  Thanks.

passenger side seat belt when retracted; rattles between the seat and the door





: The display screen icon was updated overnight to display a digital clock on the split screen; the widget will no longer allow the weather update to display.  this is also happening on my husband's vehicle...both are 2015 models
woodgrain scrathces easily on center console;
My prior 3 series did the same thing; it will down shift harshly.
Would prefer a button to open & close trunk automatically. It becomes cumbersome to take out the remote to open and to close the trunk takes to much strength on my part.
In order to lock and unlock the passenger door from the inside; one must reach over to the front center of the dashboard.  Unable to lock doors from the inside of the car. Having the lock buttons on the side panel would be more convenient.
automatically defaults to IPod when plugged in even when other App is running; such as Audiobooks on Audible.com.

back doors are hard to open due ; feels like the door sticks to the car until you give it a hard budge.
when car unlocked trunk stays locked  ; you always have to double unlock to get to the trunk

Daytime left headline failed.
: The seat adjustment does not go quite high enough and I must use a pillow. Not good fro a BMW.


There is a bug with the iPhone. I tried to play music and it does not recognize.
Sometimes when giving commands;the system misinterpreted what I requested; I.e.; such as a street name; city and state. It doesn't happen often; but it happens.
Slight rattle in the A pillar area interior on driver's side.
This involves the sensor not detecting the foot when passed under rear bumper. It only works intermittently.
Door sticks and need to force it to open : No other just driver door stiff when open
See my comments in the previous 'Interior' section. : Rear view mirror is set too dark.  I can only see headlights behind me; but I would rather see more definition of the cars behind me.  Very different from my 2008 535BMW.   There is no day/night adjustment for those preferring to see more than just headlights.   I had to cover the small circle on rear view mirror with masking tape since the dealer told me nothing could be done. With the small circle covered; I can see more of the cars behind me.   I think this is definitely a design flaw as the dealer said other customers have mentioned this as well.
The control to open/close ventilation in both front and back are difficult to figure out. The back ventilation doesnt have a different control



what else can you say other than the system does not understand my voice or speech.
: I often get an indicaton that I have an 'active call' this being my own phone number even though I have not made a call nor even touched my phone. This disallows my using the radio until I deactivate this 'call' by actually making a call and hanging up.

This is my 4th BMW. This POI is worst than before. Hard to use.  Too many steps to get what u want. Very disappointed that BMW went in the wrong direction for their POI/NAV
cant figure out how to adjust head rest
back of seats are easily marked by anyone wearing shoes who come in contact with them; as well as lower door panels when entering or exiting
A slight wind noise from the driver's side door between just above the side view mirror and the door rubber beading.

KEYLESS ENTRY SHOULD BE STANDARD. MY PRIUS HAS IT. ALSO WHEN GETTING OUT OF CAR YOU NEED TO EITHER USE THE KEY OR REACH ACROSS CENTER CONSOLE TO OPENN THE BACK DOOR WHICH I DO 'EVERY' TIME I GET OUT OF THE CAR.
SYSTEMS WILL NOT SHUT OFF WHEN CAR IS TURNED OFF; THE CAR NEEDS TO LOCKED FOR EVERYTHING TO SHUT OFF


IDLES VERY ROUGH ESPECIALLY IN THE MORNING.

GEAR SHIFT KNOB IS EASY TO BUMP INTO NEUTRAL. MANUAL SHIFTING IS HARD; NEVER KNOW WHAT 'GEAR' ITS GOING TO GO INTO.


When verbally inputting an address; the system sometimes misunderstands me. This is despite the fact that I have a flat; Mid Western US accent.
Spring tabs will not retract easily unless cup is exactly centered -- sometimes difficult to do when driving

DISLIKE AUTOMATIC SHUT OFF AND START UP SYSTEM
WHEN SUDDEN STOP IN A STOPLIGHT.
WHEN SUDDEN BREAKING HARD IN A STOP LIGHT.
I was VERY disappointed to see that the electronic close trunk button feature was not included the 2015 528 series. The truck is very heavy and difficult to close.

I have never experienced this problem with any of my previous vehicles.
not a major issue since we can turn-off this feature.


DISCOLORATION IN PAINT IN PAINT ON BOTH SIDES WHERE REAR AND FRONT DOORS MEET
At 1;200 miles we had a complete engine failure . Had to be flat bedded to Braman BMW in West Palm Beach; Florida. Was told next day by service manager that the engine will need to be replaced. I said unacceptable that I wanted a new car. I was able to engage Buzz Braman directly. He was very gracious and understanding when I said I will not accept that car back. 3 weeks later they called and said come get your NEW 2015 car. I thanked Mr Braman and said I will recommend his name to ALL my friends. He said ' Thank you for your kind words and patience as it was a 'process' he had to work through. The day of the breakdown they flat bedded a 2015 5 series to my front door for us to use during the process. We HIGHLY ; HIGHLY recommend Braman
main issue is difficult to navigate the system.  voice control is very frequently wrong.
mainly an issue when the car is moving.  Very hard to correct errors.
would be nice if verbal commands to do everything.  Most voice commands misinterpreted.
: The automatic climate control for air conditioning works VERY POORLY.   For example; if it is 100 degrees outside; and you have the auto climate set to 64 degrees; there are 2 problems that I have not experienced in other past vehicles with this feature 1) The air takes a very long time be begin blowing when set on the 'auto' feature; and 2) as described; on a hot day the A/C should automatically kick into MAX cooling; however; it blows very meagerly  even though the interior of the car is unbearabley hot.   In summary; the auto A/C does NOT function as expected and is an extreme disappointment.   I am told there is nothing wrong with my car; this is a standard BMW design function.
: Not a problem; but I like a horn that I can lightly tap to make a slight horn.  This horn must be fully pushed to sound.

SIRI IS MUCH BETTER.  DEALER CAN'T FIX THIS PROGRAM.
I had purchased gas and the next morning while driving the 'check engine' light came on and did not go off until I took it for service. Few days later.
: THE WINDSHIELD WASHER SYSTEM WAS NOT OPERATING WHEN THE TEMPERATURE WAS EXTREMELY COLD.  AS THE TEMPERATURE WARMED THE SYSTEM STARTED TO OPERATE.
: THE TIRE PRESSURE MONITOR INDICATED THE FRONT DRIVERS SIDE TIRE NEEDED AIR. WHEN THE ILLUSTRATION WITH THE PSI CAME UP IT SHOWED THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH AIR. THIS HAPPENED IN EXTREMELY   COLD WEATHER WHEN I DIDN'T USE THE CAR FOR A DAY. WHEN I RESET THE TIRE PRESSURE MONITOR WITHOUT PUTTING AIR IN THE TIRE; THE INDICATOR  DID NOT SHOW ANYTHING.
WHEN EXITING VEHICLE MY SHOES SCUFF LOWER PART OF DRIVERS SIDE DOOR.
Unlock switch in a pain to reach if you forget and try to open a read door
Put foot under as instructed and it may take several tries. It does not fully open always
If not tight engine light icon comes on which is not mentioned in manual
: Very complex audio; entertainment system
Does not appear that temp control has any effect
: Passenger side seatbelt knocks against the door jamb when the seat is unoccupied
i can never figure out how to get the trunk to open with the foot wave.  i should be able to walk up wave my foot and it open; if the fob is in my pocket.
: Tires; car wanders all over the road on grooved concrete roadways.
my contigo coffee mug just wont fit; its just a smidge too small.
The location is poor and the seats do not automatically adjust.
hard to pre-set; hard to change stations
In eco; when I get off the gas pedal and then put my foot on the gas pedal; it hesitates.


automatic trunk opener doesn't always work.  Feel silly waving my foot under the trunk and nothing happens

Electronic controller is too complex.  Would prefer a tuning knob and button pre-sets. Instead; need to go through several steps/menus just to change radio stations.
Horn sounded on its own; automatically & randomly
: Upon exiting car; push door open and it slams closed. Difficult to find the 'sweet spot' where door stays open.
Just not using it.
Pushing button moves mirror even accidentally. Is there no neutral position to prevent unintentional movement of mirror position?
Had to find youtube video on how to activate. Can't see whether it's on without turning steering wheel or craning neck.

When I want to listen to a lecture from my iPhone e mail. Is Bluetooth; it's a toss up whether or not it will actually play over car speakers. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. Frustration.


In my old Lexus; to return to my seat position after someone we changed it just required one press of a button. Here you need to keep the button depressed until seat finishes moving. Minor annoyance.
Can't use phone or listen to radio when defroster is on due to noise.

When requesting vehicle to 'Call Home;' vehicle often responds that there is no entry for Home .
The kick sensor seldom works. When I open trunk with the fob; it only rises 18'. I then have to push it up with my hand. Upon closing; once the latch didn't catch.
Cannot get the seats to return to memory position using my fob.
It's so loud; it's distracting.
I can't reach easily with my right arm/hand. Have to twist to use my left hand and to look inside.
Car actually arrived with dirt/scuffs on driver door sill; pedals; and center console. The console I could wipe off with some effort
Tire lost pressure causing the Tire Pressure Monitor to alert me. Tire immediately went from 39 PSI to zero. Fortunately; they are run-flats and I did get to a BMW location for service; safely. The service adviser said there was puncture but the inside was destroyed and needed to be replaced. Within the first 90 days; I had to shell out $500 for a new tire for my $70;000 brand new car!
It seems to be more related to the sunroof. When it's completely open vs tipped; there is a strong oil/greasy-like smell coming from it. I've had someone from the dealership look into it and they said they couldn't locate the source of the smell. It still lingers.
When very cold; driver door squeaks when going over some serious bumps.
Headlights always have internal condensation.
: There is no intermittent wiper setting. Rather; there is a rain sensor which is designed to work automatically. Unfortunately; the wipers tend to work far too slowly in this setting ; and there is no way to make them work more quickly; other than to switch to a manual 'On' setting.
On long highway trip; navigation system repeatedly instructed me to take exits that were not the best; direct route to my destination. In city driving; it works well.
With a car seat or child booster seat; it is very hard to access and buckle the seatbelt into the proper receptor.
Too narrow for small water bottle.
seat belt is too low hard to reach : Seat belt is very low an difficult to grab for an average height person

WILL NOT RECOGNIZE NEW PHONE

they just don't shut easy; constantly having to reopen and shut
The steering wheel does obsrtuct the views for some of the gauges and by the fact that the steering wheel adjustment is limited on the vertical it limits the drivers abilty to make the problem...not a problem
Actually 3 issues - takes way to long to heat up; it does not heat evenly across the steering wheel ; and the temperature is not warn enough
when making voice commands I make certain that any interferring noise is eliminated in the car - i.e.; the car is quiet - and it still has  frequent issues with identifying the commands as given
there are times the car simply looses my device  for a period of time and then it suddenly comes back.  also the wifi in the car sometimes does the same thing; it jsut won't connect when I play Pandora; etc.  Lastly; when playing Pandora; it does not list the songs as they play; only the first song when I activate Pandora...it plays the songs but the title of the song never changes from the first song played
It is supposed to fully open automatically but it stops halfway up.




built-in voice recognition system does not understand the names most times. When using phone; the names are not recognized. When using navigation; street names are not recognized. Almost makes this feature unusable.
Sometimes; the phone will not pair. Sometimes; the phone pairs over bluetooth; but won't play the audio from the phone.
The Passenger side seat belt buckle rattles against the pillar when not in use. This has been a problem with BMW's for quite some time. It needs to be redesigned such that when the seat belt buckle is not in use; there is some kind of padding on the pillar that prevents the buckle from rattling. : The Passenger side seat belt buckle rattles against the pillar when not in use.

one of the front reflector lights popped off
audio is not user-friendly....you cant just turn on the radio and hit your pre-set stations:  nothing happens; apparently if its on Satellite when you turn it off; thats where it stays; but its hard to figure that out when you're driving....water bottles or any tall cups placed in the cup holders obstruct access to the controls directly behind it....voice recognition is poor for phonebook requests.
: the car does not seem to keep the heat/cooling settings present when last used....it re-sets to highest degree....heated seats; as well - they must always be turned on when re-starting the car; even if they were on when you last used car.

the car is very well made however I  feel the shifter needs improvement; often times im in neutral as opposed to drive; have to stop the car and put in drive. Over the long term this cannot be good for the transmission. it takes getting used to so it doesn't happen as often however; not a fan.
Doesn't recognize names
I feel that its too sensitive and when I try to turn off right/left signals; it turns on left/right instead of turning it off...

Slow speeds when it was cold

Back spoiler won't go down
Perhaps voice recognition takes time; however I am having problems with voice recognition as it relates to navigation
the headlights are hard to see at night on dark roads in which I travel on the regular. xenon lights would work best.
The grease used the grease the sunroof smells really bad to the point we don't want to open the sun shade...
when engine is shutoff when I come to a stop; when I hit the accelerator the transmission sometimes is very abrupt; not smooth and lurches forward.
There is a grinding noise when driving real slow going up a slight hill.   Dealer says it is needing transmission fluid changed for the first 1200 miles but I haven't gotten to 1200 miles yet. They said it is a normal noise until transmission fluid is changed and not to worry about it.
Cup holders need to be relocated.  They are too close to the dash controls.  Should be moved toward the rear of the car.
Flimsy and cheap On the GT 5 series they are deep and in the same place. Should go to that style on all 5 series
JERKS. DOES NOT RETURN NORMALLY

NAIL IN TIRE




Trunk is unlocked and does not automatically raise.  You have to assist it and there is no latch on handle to grab on to.  You need both hands to push on the trunk to raise it.
Latch button on passenger side slipped and needs to be 'pulled out' and properly seated.
The radio and media controls are hard to set-up initally. I really LOVE this car; but the audio system has kicked my rear end.

Sometimes this feature engages on its own ie; without driver turning it on.

When connected to my iPhone 5S I ask for Siri but the voice recognition goes to Satellite Radio.  The first few times I could say Siri and it would connect but now it doesn't recognize the command.

the 4 retractalble prongs lock up when trying to insert my stainless steel water bottle

: When I open the front door the other doors remained locked and the button to open the other doors is on the center console which forces me to get back in the car to open the other doors.  It should be on the drivers side door
Radio just randomly turns off

: The channel/presets changer control on the steering wheel requires 2 pusses to change the channel.  It should be more like the cruise control button on the steering wheel which only require you to press to change.  Should also be on the gear shifter along with volume control.
Voice commands are too structured.  Everyday functions need some focus.  Suggest that you watch real people use the system and the commands they typically use.
When trying to use Siri on an Iphone 5 the system just hangs and then the phone gets disconnect for a about 30 seconds before I can dial again.
System is good when your input is good but it is not intuitive when it comes to basic commands like cancel; stop; quit which all mean the same thing.


It's a little difficult to place a drink in the front cup holders.  You have to push or angle the drink to get in the holder. No problem once it's in.  And no problem lifting the drink out of the cup holder.

repetitive command request due to the inability of the voice recognition to properly process the diction of commands
DONT KNOW HOW TO USE


Can not keep temporture regulated properly.
Can not keep the right temp.
: hands free w/ foot to open trunk does not work well and easily
I do not think they make BMW's as airtight as they did previously.  Wind noise is probably from doors not fitiing as close as they should.

misunderstands me and doesn't give me enough time



: few alert warning have been displayed in the dashboard






With my 2012 BMW I was in the dealership constantly; I had to have 7 tires replaced and in three years I put 6000 miles on the car because I was afraid to use it.  I decided to give BMW another try and just purchases the 2015; as of yet I have no problems; however I was very disappointed that BMW did not offer me anything for all my trouble.
: As of now only with the phone contacts; I haven't had a chance to go to the dealer to try and fix the problem.
I believe this may be a problems on Apples side but I am not sure. Sometimes my phone will connect to the Bluetooth and other times it wont. I have heard rumors that it has something to do with Apples new operating system.

Completely misinterprets from time to time.
Height involves pressing recline and tilt function bar at the same time. Does not work seamlessly.



I cannot locate the headrest adjustment-controls
There is an intermittent rattle. The dealer said it was related to the seat belt but I do not think this is the cause.
GAS CAP DOOR BLEMISH-- DIFFERENT COLOR

There was a spot of paint that had chipped off; that was clear to determine since the edges of the remaining paint were rough.

I put my purse on the passenger seat and it always seems to have stains on it.  My purse is clean; why is this happening.
Three complaints with the front cup holders.  It is directly in front of the temperature control buttons.  If you put anything other than a small take out cup in the front holders; you must reach around them to press climate control buttons.  And that goes for seeing the digital screen that displays the temperature etc. Then they are difficult to use. Beverage cups must be inserted into the hole at an angle. This creates spills. The buttons inside the hole seem to be square; making the cups very difficult to slide past and push them in.  The buttons on my last BMW were curved and therefore the cup slid right over them while they depressed into the holder.  Because they are a hard square plastic; putting a Styrofoam cup into the holder is dangerous.  These buttons push into the Styrofoam leaving an indentation along the way.  This happens every time the cup is taken in and out and leaves me worrying if the hard square plastic buttons are going to rip through my coffee cup.
What can I say; people are lazy or not agile and they are constantly scrapping their shoes across the door sill and then hit the lower door panel with their shoes.  Not only do these areas scuff easily; but they do not clean up!  I even got BMW's interior cleaner.  I still have marks.

brakes squeak. delaership said will go away in time; but hasnt
see past comment

all adjustment knobs are in same locationa nd hard to maneuver

sometimes the door won't close; the metal lever inside the door seems to think it's closed but it's open.  I need to pull the lever on the inside the door and it'll then work
trunk is heavy to open and doesn't have auto-close
after 10 minutes of driving; they become noisy and squeak
prefer proper hand brake
no spare tire at all!!!  and no runflats either!
just doesn't recognize anything
white seat is blue after one week because I wear jeans
BMW has this lever in the center of the center a/c vents seemingly every BMW that goes from red to blue and seems to be completely independent from the climate controls that do the same exact thing.  No dealer or service technician or manual has been able to tell me exactly what it does.
came from aftermarket installation of tinted screed
Misinterpretation is common in all our BWMs
Computer module for collision avoidance/cruise control failed while driving.   It was fixed promptly under warranty and is now working fine.  This only happened once; about 3 months after I told delivery.


: Heads-up; lane-departure; early collision; all malfunctioned.  Problem turned out to be forward camera; which had to be replaced.  Part was ordered from Germany.  Car out of service for approximately two-thirds of month.

Trunk release has a foot motion operatuing control. It stopped working days after car was delivered. Since been repaired under warranty of manufacturer
The run flat tires themselves are still OK; but they destroyed two wheels  which have been replaced already; after about 2;000 miles
In city; some stations; including high wattage ones; provide a muffled or unclear transmission of sound. Had better reception on previous cars
This applies to the central rear seat belt. Once the belt is buckled; the retractor pulls the belt tight and restricts passenger motion and presses uncomfortably on front of passenger.

Needs  only one opening door rather than two.
The compartment above the drink holder is so small and akward to use
Waving foot underneath sometimes works; sometimes doesn't. Can't figu out why.
Requires taking hand off wheel to operate; and excessive pressure to activate
Default seems to be activation of all cameras; not simply rear view. Took a while to figure out how to make it work
Headlight washers are very confusing. Sometimes they go on and sometimes they don't. There should be a separate button. Not just when you do the windshield fluid
Door unlock button is in horrible location. It should be on doors instead it's in center if dash
I could not figure this option out for the first week I had the car. Very confusing symbols on dash
This system makes no sense.  When I'm driving slow and a car is in my blind spot. The light goes on sometimes. Not all the time. The indicator light should also be on the mirror part like all other car manufacturers.
Horrible location for a button I use often

The windshield defogger makes the car extremely hot and stuffy inside even when set at 70 degrees or below
I have the 435i; it has dual tail pipes yet vapor only comes out of the right side.  I get icicles on the left one bec there is no heat coming out
Very deep and rough scratch on one of the wheel spokes.
Excess clear left a large drip on the inside of the fender.
For some reason the door wouldn't close all the way for a day or two.  It seemed to be off the normal path of closure and was hitting the cap which was keeping it from closing.   somehow fixed itself
Does not always responded to my foot when swinging under the area
Brakes squeak when cold or wet. Dealer said this is normal. : Squeaking brakes
The navigation system usually choose a longer way for me to go.
usually choose a longer way for me to go.



When the steering wheel is in a certain position; I cannot see the heated steering wheel button to see whether it is on or off.
There are a lot of icons down the side of the map that I do not know what the mean or 'do'
Recently noticed discoloration of the drivers seat after only 4 months
The intermittent function of the wipers are hard to understand and /or don't work well.  They may meet the design; but leaves me  with an issue when the window has more rain on it than the wipers will clear; but not enough to go up to the continuous low speed.  My precious Lexus RX300 and VW Jetta work better.
The navigation system down selects letters when entering an address; so that sometimes; you cannot enter the entire street or town name.  For example; entering WALSH street and you enter in W-A and then no L is available for selection. Very frustrating when you are lost or trying to get somewhere important.
The passenger seat belt when not in use bangs against the side of the car; especially on turns.  Very annoying when driving alone.
The cup holder is limiting -- too small.

After hitting a moderate bump; I can hear a rattle coming from the back seat rear door.
Satellite radio had stopped working - it kept searching for a signal. I called SiriusXM and they said there was no signal issue and my radio was active. My radio had stopped working for about 4 hours.
Got a low voltage message. Car instructed me to keep the engine running.  Happened on a trip to Canada in the winter. Doesn't seem to be reliable in cold weather temperatures. I was worried I would be stranded.
I had a major problem with the door locks trying to get the locking mechanism to unlock using the remote control and the finger touch control after I opened the backseat first.  The door locked and I could not close the door because the lock wouldn't go in so I could completely close the door to the driver's side.  Finally I figured out accidentally how to open the door by using the handle although I figured the remote control would be able to do that but apparently not.  Very confusing.
: The car completely stalled resulting in a loss of all controls. Steering and braking. A warning message came up on the screen stating a drive-train malfunction and the engine light came on. The car was towed to the dealer where we leased the vehicle. After almost a week of trying to diagnose the issue they said it was a result of water that was spilled in the trunk shorting out the electronics under trunk floor. The unit had to be replaced for over $1000.00 and was not covered under warranty. The floor of the trunk is easily removable made with what appears to be basically carpet covered cardboard. The engineering design that went into this system for a $120;000.00 CAR IS A JOKE. Not to mention an extreme liability potential for BMW. If this incident had occurred at a high speed on the freeway it would have been an extremely deadly outcome. I would highly recommend they  to put a warning label in the trunk not to transport anything that could possibly leak.

should be an automatic close for the cost
COMING FROM CARS THAT HAVE AUTOMATIC TRUNKS; I WAS SURPRISED THIS ONE DIDNT. THE FLIP IS DIFFICULT WITH ONE HAND.
SYSTEM DROPS THE PHONE OFTEN
IT'S THE WORST OVE SEEN
AT 7;161 MILES  2 QUARTS OF OIL HAD TO BE ADDED.


pops open....possible from key when in pocket. probably to sensitive.
Front driver for speaker was blown after hitting large pothole.  Rear deck speaker as well; same manner. B&O upgraded sound sys.    

: The vehicle doesn't coast comfortably in any setting 'comfort'; 'eco-drive'; 'sport' etc.  Not sure if this is because it is recharging auxiliary battery but it makes for an uncomfortable ride at low speeds.

: Headrest 'pushes' head forward - requires having seat reclined too much in order to relieve pressure on head and neck.
too many to follow






can't identify normal english words

Takes about 45 minutes before the temperature seems to start to work correctly.  In the sun; hot interior; fan hardly blows air.

Does not open with foot as it should and key fob sometimes takes multiple hits to get it to open.
Flat spot in the run flat tire from sitting on the dealer lot too long.
Will not play music from my iPhone. : Bluetooth interface does not play music from my iPhone.
They just suck.  They were no bueno on my 2012 650 too.

: RIGHT SIDE DRIVER WINDOW HAVE OUTSIDE AIR COMING IN ... YOU CAN HEAR IT WHILE DRIVING



: Engine Light Car Stalled
They worked on it for three months and couldn't fix it : Engine Light Car Stalled


have programmed to open only driver door when I touch handle.   Have to get into seat completely in order to reach door unlock button for other doors.
Indicator needs to be larger and brighter.
It will tell us to exit and take thru neighborhood streets instead of continuing on toll road to proper exit.
Wind noise from the windows.

There is not enough space.
You need to remove the phone cradle. This took away a lot of storage space and as you know the  650 series does not have a lot of space to being with. Not a good design idea at all.
dealer did fix most of the issue. still rattles at certain speeds. seat belt must be locked in order not to hear any sound.
Steering wheel would shake and you could hear a grinding noise when I braked hard from higher speeds.
when cups in holder it blocks many controls
Does not have aotomatic door seal
Door does not have automatic seal when closing
Trunk does not have autonatic close button
bubbles under the clear coat
the seat does not always return to the memory of the key being used
handle is in a poor location and confusing to passengers. the wood board they use is silly
useless!!!!! there is no audio indicator.. and it fails to really work as often as it should.  if I wasnt paying attention; the indicator would have failed to avoid an accident alert IN TIME to actually avoid it.
bad position
sometimes it keeps getting the wrong name on voice and no matter what it doesnt correct.
: the phone calls its OWN number upon blue tooth connect. happened in my old 7 series too. have to hang up phone upone entry into car

center storage is not useful and the plugs for phone are in a bad spot.
this floor mat anchor is useless.. the velcro pulls the anchor out of the floor and the dealer has to re drill the holes for the anchor to hold. its a poor system and the mats are rarely able to stay in place. Even the adhesive slowly moves and the mat shifts.  MY 4 runner mat is perfect. take a lesson from that
it's so hard to put in the right position. i gave up finally.

CAN NOT RECOGNIZE THE LOCATION; HAS BEEN GIVING ME ANOTHER NAME OF LOCATION
HAD GIVEN ME LEFT INSTEAD OF RIGHT OR LEFT BUT NO LEFT OR HAD GONE TO ANOTHER CITY/STATE
The display is very hard to see if you are wearing polarized lens of any kind - no matter what adjustment you use.  Otherwise the HUD is very good.
It's weird but sometimes the a/c does not reflect the setting and/or the a/c is not sufficiently removing humidity.
Again; the dial is in the way of seeing buttons on console and the dial ins hard to use

The dial is hard to use
I blame this on the prep guys as they put swirls  in the paint; which than I have to have corrected by a proper detail/paint correction. Not worth taking back as they will just compound the problem.
Takes a lot of pedal push; seems the brakes could use some more boost.
Should be power.
Sensors are only on the front doors for keyless entry and locking; vs. sensors on all doors; i.e.:to enter rear doors you must first go to front door to unlock the vehicle; than to rear door once all are unlocked same with locking. I do not use the fob to unlock as it's a convience feature to not use it. There should be sensors on all four doors. There is no issue with the trunk as it open from the kick sensor.
Seems you have to turn on the park sensors/camera when needed. Will need to talk to the BMW genius as perhaps it will engage automatically.
The verbal command functions are hard to follow; seems you have to be very automated in speaking; and only with the programmed commands and have to yell/speak very loud; poor interface as it's faster and easier to use SIRI on the phone. The touch feature on the knob is easier to enter with for numbers and letters but a distraction for the driver; and difficult for the passenger as it's too small. Wheres the large iPad type screen with touch.
It's just too complicated and if you don't know the right commands very frustrating. almost need a krib sheet for the commands. So much so it's easier to use the phone; but it won't interface with the car for navigation. No touch screen.
It looks like there was a yellow liquid that spilled; it does not come off.
Did not recognize the USB drive I used.
several small chips in glass




My husband does not feel as though the seats are wide enough; even after the width is wide open with the power function - he finds it uncomfortable.
Smell still exists; especially if I haven't driven the car for a few days!
: When car is in economy ; and I pull into my garage to park ; the engine wil die and then have to restart to finish parking.
The function doesn't seem consistent 
1.  The steering wheel audio controls are on the right side; which is very inconvenient. 2.  The menu structure for imported media is very difficult to navigate; doesn't load albums in the correct order unless a separate button press is made; difficult to search for and organize music.
Seems to have trouble switching users very frequently; requiring manual reset.
The headrest does not go down far enough and the controls are difficult to use.
When backing out of the garage in the mornings; the brakes squeak pretty loudly.
Seems like it hs a dirty hue only after 2 months of getting in and out of the car around the edges of the seat and seat back.
The drivers side of the front window fogs up more and does not clear as quickly as the passenger side.
The cup doesn't want to lift out easily and it is at an odd angle due to the dashboard directly above it.
I think it may be normal due to I'm use to driving the 535GT and the braking power was so powerful in that car.


controle don't seem to get you where you want to go
: the system is poorly designed.  the dashboard turning dial is the only control that really controls the heating /cooliong
GAS MILEAGE IS BELOW 20MPG; EVEN IN ECCO PRO MODE






typical run flat tire problems

System is too complicated requiring too many steps.  Voice recognition does not like a woman's voice.

front signal only works when the car is first put in reverse; very poor design.

misinterprets commands  when either my wife or I are using the system


THE BLUETOOTH SHOWS THE PHONE CALLING ITSELF FREQUENTLY.








Uses a pushbutton and adjustment isnt straightforward
Turn signal is too light. As it is the same control as the high beam; sometimes the high beam flickers on when only the turn signal is intended.
In order to open the sunroof completely; the button needs to be pressed twice; and can only be pressed the second time once the first button press has completely opened the shade. Shouldn't there be a way to open the entire sunroof + shade with one press?
Not convenient to require the car be in park AND the door be closed.
The 'prongs' in the cupholder make it difficult to insert any type of container. I almost always have to jiggle or force even a standard sized cup into it.
Car will shake slightly when I first turn on the engine. This happens occasionally; probably 5 times in the last 3 months.
OCCASIONALLY SQUEAKY WHEN I REVERSE OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY IN THE MORNING.  THEN GOES AWAY ONCE I GO FORWARD.
IT'S INSIDE THE CENTER CONSOLE.  I HOOK MY IPHONE6+ INSIDE THE CONSOLE.  IF I CLOSE IT; I HAVE TO OPEN EVERY TIME I NEED TO ACCESS THE PHONE.  IF I LEAVE THE CONSOLE OPEN; THERE'S NOWHERE TO PUT MY ELBOW.
TOO SMALL.
When back seat windows are rolled down during motion there is a load noise that can be heard through out the car that is ear piercing. Back windows can not be rolled down while car is in motion.

: The cupholders are too small!  They fit a normal size drink but not my iPhone 6+.
The floor mats do not match the space in the back row - they are a little large.
Noticed at freeway speeds
Iphone connectivity issue - text messages/EMails/Calendar does not sync.

This is the most comfortable leather seat I have owned; but the seat scuffed when I scraped something it that I didn't expect to damage the seat.  I also set my computer bag on the back seat and it left a mark.  My computer bag is clean and doesn't have any sharp features on it.

Front seat not as roomy as previous car. Have found very comfortable position; but it took awhile.
Hard to locate quickly when driving
: other than a little noise none
: other than a little noise none
I don't use voice commands too often--seems to be difficult
: The heated seat feature on the drivers seat gets too hot even on the lowest setting




: The 'fast' windshield wiper wipe is still to slow for moderate to heavy rain conditions.


My wife says it's difficult to figure out how to change the radio station.
The route given is never clear cut and is often a very indirect route.  We tease that my wife's Mercedes navi is much better even though it is a few years older.
Issues with iPhone pairing and then holding connection would drop and then reconnect at times. Went to BMW they seem to think it is a apple issue.
Could be operator error; not sure.  Paired phone just fine; but when calling out or receiving calls in the vehicle; party to whom driver is speaking cannot hear his/her voice.

The switch Does not engage; it clicks as if To work but nothing happens.

Car started and engine was running fine  but transmission wouldn't shift out of park.  Turned off ignition and restarted and problem was gone.  Only happened once and approximate mileage was 1000 miles.  Check engine light wasn't lit when restarted.
There place it is located; it cases the USB cable to crack and need to replace often.
Not sure if it is because of my accent; but is does not recognize what I say.
Drivers seat has wrinkles near bottom portion. This has happened to car less than a month of ownership.  Complained to manufacturer.  There answer is the upholstery is Nappa Leather which is very  soft and that causes the wrinkles. I do not believe this is right especially after having car for only 1 month.  I do not think I would buy a BMW anymore. : There are wrinkles in other sections of the seats including passenger side and back seat. I rarely drive the car for this problem to happen so soon.  I could understand if it happened after  6 months or a year.
The blind spot monitors are on the stem that holds the mirror and are difficult to locate when looking at the mirror. The system apparently does not operate under a certain speed - maybe 30 MPH.
: My navigation has traffic and there are too many secondary streets that appear on the screen making it difficult to see/read the traffic on the freeways.
I am 6'2' and the top of the display gets cut off no matter how I position the display.
There are blue marks on the white leather seats if you drive the car with blue jeans on.
There are several scuff marks on the plastic part of my chair.  I have tried degreaser; all purpose cleaner; water; and Mr Clean's Magic Eraser to no avail.  It simply will not come off.

: The remote-key-operated trunk release sometimes doesn't work and the 'lock all button' on the inside of the trunk sometimes has to be pressed twice or three times to close.
It paired and loaded at the dealership but then 'went missing' so I could not answer the phone when driving and had no contacts list in the car.  It later 're-paired' and then unpaired again.  It has now repaired and doesn't seem to have any other problems.
The built-in voice recognition misinterprets commands.
Center console arm rest squeaks when you put arm on it.
The headlights are aimed at the sides of the road; which leave a dark 'v' shaped pattern in the middle of the road. They are also a bit too low.
Intermittent wiper control settings don't seem to react to changes. It should go faster or slower based on where the dial is set but it seems to have a mind of its own.
Even if you get the address correct at some point; it changes it anyway to another sate and address. . Addrtess has to be entered manually one charater at a time to work.
: The built in navigation is a pain to operate and is sometimes completely useless. Does not recognize voice commands at all and will change destination on its own in the midst of entering a new address. Directions given can be way off and send you in the wrong direction. Good thing I have a smartphone for navigation.

Does not recognize voice commands at all and will change destination on its own in the midst of entering a new address. Directions given can be way off and send you in the wrong direction. Good thing I have a smartphone for navigation.
You have to hold the button down for the entire time it takes to change to a preset. Sometimes a new setting does not get stored in memory.
Has difficulty interpreting words; names; etc.
Some times mobile phone will call out without command disabling audio feature.
The external motion activated release doesn't always work.
Wheel was replaced within the next 2 days.
: Hands Free trunk opener intermittently functions.


POSITION OF MY SEATS MAKE MY LEFT LEG NUMB.
carpet often gets foot stuck when applying gas.
sounds not smooth.  clunky and awkwardly noisy
shotty tint job
: Hard to use/operate trunk release sensor under bumper.
M-Sport brakes cause excessive dust.

I cannot get the sensor under the trunk to work consistently when my hands are full. I have to resort to manually opening the trunk.
Defective crankshaft sensors.
Brake squeal at slow stops.
Excessive brake dust despite moderate or gentle braking habits.  Frustrating that wheels get so dirty after just washing or detailing vehicle.
Due to the red color the leather seems to pickup color from jeans very quickly; turns blue but when it is cleaned it comes off.

The turbo charger which was replaced by BMW.
The phone will pare with the vehicle; but the vehicle will not send commands to start and/or change music selections. The heads up display indicates the song list; but will not select a change when entered. The rotary dial on the vehicle Idrive will change the music selection. The dealer states this is a problem with them phone. My phone provider says is a problem with the vehicle paring.
The smell is a mildew smell when first entering the vehicle after it has sat in the garage a few days unused. the smell disappears once the ventilation system has run for a few minutes
Sometimes won't open up
Low beams aimed 'too downward'-adjusted; now as they should be. This was noted very early on & easily corrected.
: Lost audio in satellite radio in first week. Mileage indicator; e.g. 22 miles also disappeared. Dashboard computer bad; replaced; & all is fine.
: The aluminum wheels don't hold up well in northeast winters.  All 4 of my wheels bent because of potholes.
the phone losses bluetooth connection.  This may be an issue with iOS
Front seat passenger sensor is way too sensitive.  If I put my iPad on the seat it thinks there is a person there and the fasten seatbelt alert tones ring.  Either needs to be tuned down or have shut off.

just no user friendly
Passenger air bag not on warning has come in about 4 weeks time as of yesterday
Just a squeak.



Stops at awkward point causing constant raytling noise.





: Extremely poor technology. Bluetooth does not work properly with any smart phone.


Seems to be aimed too low; I am not certain whether it is aimed as designed but is different then my last vehicle.
It often gets the wrong number.  Sometimes when you say the proper command; it tells you what the command options are.
Clear coat not uniform in one spot on deck lid - clearly a factory body shop issue
I hear a 'BUMP' when i stop as if something is in the trunk.


Misaligned at delivery



: Note: This could be consider more of a design flaw than a quality issue.  Most cars will allow you to fold the windshield wipers leaving both of your hands free to clean the windshield glass. The hood of this car is high enough and the wipers' folding ponits are low enough that there is no way to completely fold the whipers; sometimes scratching the paint of the hood's edge if not careful.
Gas and brake pedals are too close to each other. I have to keep my right heel in a slightly awkward position to reach both without raising the foot. It's weird because I don't have small feet - I wear 11.5-12. Maybe because of the design of the gas pedal which seems to have a hinge on the floor?
: A. The electrical steering box seems to have 2 big issues compared to standard hydraulic steering :   1. Almost 0 feedback from the road.    2. Return to center is very weak almost 0.  As consequences:  - Driving straight on highway seems odd/tricky as you need to carefully make sure you keep the car perfectly straight/aligned as the car needs constant steering input. The driving experience in my opinion suffers a lot. I read and researched about this issue. It's explained and documented in caranddriver.com. I'm hoping that the issue is improved by future software updates although I don't hold my breath.  B. Driving dynamics control settings reset to normal after engine is restarted. This design issue is ridiculous in my opinion. I bought a Sport Line but my car Driving Dynamics defaults to Normal after engine is restarted. Really??? I raised this with the dealer. They said it's a known issue and the region representative was notified.

: This is a design issue for the Standard Cluster display. The speedometer is a bit small and a bit harder to read as compared with other cars I drive. The more difficult ones are speed values like 35; 45; 55 etc. I have very good vision and I don't need/wear glasses.
There are significant swirl marks over the entire car. They attempted to 'buff' it out with only temporary success. The issues remains open!
: radio station presets do not advance properly.
gets caught on seat and folds
: Clutch seems weak.
Color transfer from pants on both driver and passenger seats after just 1 month.
The foot wave option seems difficult to use and I end up having to use the key bob.
The run flat tires give a very rough ride in Denver's streets filled with pot holes.   When a pot hole is hit; I did not see; it is a hard jolt and I worry about the tire and rim.
Move too quickly to only 'crack' the window open a little.   Difficult to stop when only wanting a small opening.

Pretty much covered above.  Driver side passenger window fogs up quite a bit due to cold and/or damp weather.  I consider this to be very minor as my overall satisfaction with the vehicle is very high.
when car starts;;it seems very high sounds - I don't expect that from new car

I was just surprised to see it didn't have rear wiper


You can't have your right hand comfortably placed while driving. Painful especially on long drive

the standard seat are not comfortable; thin padding no support.  Too nice a car for these seats.
Cannot come closer than 3 miles from my home. Constantly takes devious routes to reach a destination. Even directed me to take two U-turns on the same road  two days ago. My cell phone using google directions never has any of these problems.
the car needed to be clay barred and buffed with surface swirls all over the car. Seemed better after that was done but now I notice strange swirl marks almost like a haze. Paint job is terrible!
There is a strange smell when the sun roof is open. Almost like grease or oil.
I find that it is in a poor location & a bit difficult to use.

because the cup holders are so close to the dash; and they are slightly under the dash where is curves out; the tall 9'; 20 oz starbucks insulated cups; and tall 24 oz tervis tumblers hit the dash; and must be tipped forward to wiggle out.
We notice there is sometimes a rusty looking fluid coming from under passenger side door on exterior. Noticed at dealership and they cleaned it but it comes back.
After trial and error; and looking things up; I figured it out; but these could be explained before you drive away with your new vehicle.
Though I understood the warning; I did not understand how to get rid of the warning once I aired up the tires.
The system is nice; but there are a lot of steps to get to the system. Additionally; the touchpad needs a dual or up/down buttons on the right side near the passenger seat for volume. It seems cumbersome to have all the other controls at your fingertips; but have to move your right hand back up to the dash system to control the volume.
The airflow indicators were hard to understand at first; and you have to keep pushing the button to get the flow where you want it which doesn't seem to have a logical pattern.
: Squeak or vibration in back of steering column when driving on certain surfaces
Only available for iPhone.




When closing the trunk lid; it does not latch easily.  It will latch when firmly closed.
The steering wheel blocks the view of the start button.
Need to pull hand brak as far back as possible when on a slight or greater incline.
Was told that engine with turbo charger will consume more oil until it settles in...
In the regular setting the steering is much looser than my 335xi. Have not driven it too much yet though
I have not driven it in the winter; only the fall; so it might just be that I did not drive enough before putting up for winter.
The trunk does not latch closed if it is closed too quickly; the trunk must be closed slowly and firmly
If the car doors are locked while refueling; the fuel door will not close.
The parking brake sometimes needs an extra tug; and the car must be left in gear.
The wiper speed options are limited.
The direction to turn the controls off is not intuitive.
The automatic display prevents viewing of the clock momentarily upon start-up
Turning off the HD function solved the problem.
The tan shows any amount of dirt and scuffs easily.
Reverse is sometimes difficult to find; and the car can be accidentally put in reverse instead of first.
I think that using your foot to open it takes too long it you don't get it perfectly right. Sometimes I am in the pkg lot kicking my foot 5 or more times prolly looking like a dumbass next to my shiney new cute Beamer and ppl who see me prolly think 'my american ford trunk opens just perfectly' I live in MI; the MOTOR CITY. I do get dirty looks for driving my car. as T.swift says; haters gonna hate hate hate. Also; why do you have to hold down the trunk button for so long on the key? That feels like forever too.
I don't like having to push the button twice to get the car to turn completely off.





I read the instructions many times and still cant figure to out.
The car jerks neither to the right or left - just upon acceleration.
After stopping at a red light; the vehicle feels like it has stopped totally.  Then; when I accelerate; the vehicle jerks forward.

The entire device is inferior.  It is easier to use the hand controls rather than using the voice commands.  The navigation does not provide enough time to make the necessary turns.  My Hyundai was easier to utilize.

The seat is very low.  I am 5'8' and find it to be a low drop.  The seat needs to be able to go up more.  Also; difficult to get out of.  Even with utilizing all the adjustments; I am unable to get it right.  I did the best I could.
Have to slam trunk to get it to shut.
Dealership had to replace MAF sensor. Bad MAF put car into 'limp' mode where engine would only operate at 1/2 power.  Made for an unsafe driving situation.
Hood does not close flush with front fender panel.
doors d not remain open- they bounce back and hit you
doors do not stay open and come back and hit you in the legs; etc. Door stops should keep the door open
keep it simple-make it easy
blends in with other information
overly complicated- too many steps to get to what you want
overly complicated- too many steps to perform a simple task
not easy to locate adjustment for reclining the head rest
the 'teeth' desogend to hold he cup in are unnecessary- many cups won't fit
: Whistling noise from the front of the car.
sounds like a plastic sticking problem
won't open : moon roof is stuck and wont open
Trunk should have had auto close feature
Auto headrest adjustment does not work. Will resolve during first service appt.

See previous
Instructions for use/disable are counterintuitive.
UBS port not connection. Car had to be returned and a 'major' component needed to be replaced.
Did not work initially but started working 2 days later. Noted on initial delivery inspection. NO explanation for this.

I should have stuck with the 6 cylinder like the 640 coupe that I traded in; not the 8 cylinder.  my mistake/fault!
It can be difficult to depress the gas pedal without also partially depressing the brake. I have a wide foot and an extra inch would be very helpful.
Dynamic suspension failed and light came on.  Basically; the shock absorbers were not activated and caused us to have a very hard ride.  Happened a couple times.  Took it to dealer who determined a vertical sensor may have failed so they replaced it.  So far the light has not come back on. : See dynamic shock-absorber problem.
I am too short so to put my leg underneath the car to open the trunk is very diffcult
There is a blemish of paint on the bottom of the front bumper- its more of a blemish then a scratch or chip from road debri
The entire stereo had to be replaced after the first 2 weeks of having the veh- we were out of the car for over a month-
same as the previous comment...  I am going to bring it to the attention of the service department when the car is scheduled to go in for maintenance.
We cannot determine if the noise if coming from the glove box or the center console. It is a very frustrating noise that does not go away.
I WOULD PREFER IF THE STEERING SYSTEM WERE STIFFER BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW ME TO HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER THE STEERING



Even the car salesman had issues when demonstrating the feature.   It's an iPhone 6 so it's the most advanced version but yet the issue persists.   It works fine occasionally but I often have to make the connection manually.  Using the phone for tunes is equally frustrating.
Routing is frequently inaccurate and would cause us to drive excessive distances if we had not known the routes better than the navigation system. Does not choose optimum routes.
The car has a feature by which it is supposed to sense me dragging my foot under the license plate; which then is supposed to magically open the hatch.  It works maybe 1 of out 10 times.  A waste of money and not worth the trouble.
One of the two fog lights is on every time I start the car.  When I turn on the fog lights 'button;' then both work.
Just a very poor design.  Only operates above a certain speed; and then it seems to function only intermittently.  I was hoping it was work as well as the one on my Suburban.  Another waste of money with my BMW.
Just a terrible design on the car's voice recognition system.  Soooo much easier just to tell Siri what I want to do.  Too bad Siri can't transmit directions/address to my GPS on the car.
I just can't figure it out.  Too many buttons down there.  Not like my previous BMW.
Just can't figure it out.  Not intuitive.
My 5-series controlled temperature beautifully in the front; but poorly in the back.  But this one  has almost no air for the back; and just controls poorly in the front.
Somewhere on the instrument panel; steering wheel; somewhere.. I got that annoying rattling noise which occurs at certain speeds; and definitely when there's even just medium audio system volume. This problem is even worse on my friend's 2013 328i..
It's just not the best of cup holder designs.. Nothing holds the cups in place. I've seen better in other cars.
Every time I have passengers in the back seat; I noticed the floor both floor mats are crushed to the front. Horrible..
I feel like this is the case with all of my BMWs. I may have gotten used to it; but I'm always aware of it. By the way; it's not a BIG DEAL.
loss of engine power indicator read that drive drive was limited

Brake dust a bit too much on front wheels
Electronic parking brake takes a while to get used to
Display difficult to understand.  Display hard to see especially at night and needs manual sceen brightness adjustment.
Head up display not compatible with polarized sunglasses
Too many steps and poor menu structure.  iDrive system not user friendly and has a learning curve to it.
Light interior gets stained easily
Fan not the quietest
Light interior color is too white and next to impossible to keep clean
: THE HEATER AND AIR IS VERY NOISY.
WHEN THE CUP HOLDER IS OPEN AND THERE IS  A CUP THE CONSOLE IS NOT USEFUL AT ALL.
About 50 percent of the time when I want to play music off of my phone's playlist via Bluetooth it doesn't work.
It is a known problem that all new BMWs do not recognize George bush or Dallas north tollway. Very very annoying. Dealership said to call corporate. Corporate says ' we know about the problem'.  They have done nothing to resolve the issue. How can this be?  It is a known problem and these are two very traveled roads. I use them every day.

This system has yet to recognize my commands to call my contacts.  It is sometimes accurate in the Navigation program for the street number.  I usually just give up and have to use my phone.
Will not automatically pair when I enter the phone; sometimes it switches phones on its own.  Should I have to select bluetooth each time I enter the car?
I have to open the door to see the numbers for the memory selection; dark interior.  I am 5'3' tall and for me they are too low on the door; I have to open the door to see the number. I am unable to raise the seat so that I can look over the steering wheel. : My problem occurs each time I drive.
woodgrain plastic on center console shows scratches
Rear right seat belt buckle is not locking in buckle receptacle properly.
For some reason; even when I turn off the air conditioning unit upon parking; when I restart the car; the air conditioning unit automatically comes on at a temperature of 60 degrees or so.  I would think that if I have turned off the unit; that it would remain off upon restarting the car.  It's more an annoyance than anything because the unit actually works fine.


After all these years and new technology that this issue has not been corrected!
Would like the ability to lock the doors when I get out of the car and not use the remote key.  Also car not lock the doors if it detects a remote key left inside the car .
Description in the manual hard to understand.
Should be able to pre program mirror location to drives seat adjustment.


Memory seat set up hard to understand and operate.


: Driver's side exterior mirror does not always return to regular position when car is taken out of reverse.
It's intermittent and I haven't yet asked the dealer to look at the issue.  I will ask at next service appointment.  Not a big deal.

It may be natural due to dual turbo & small size engine

When coming to complete stop it has harsh shift. : When downshifting gears and coking to complete stop and especially from third gear to second.

Address is often completely misunderstood by navigation system. About 75% of the time.
Often the paired device won't play through the speakers. As a workaround; I have to select another connection source like 'Auxiliary Input' then select my phone again for playback to start.
I don't like that the system won't stay off if I turn the car off and back on again. Sometimes I don't want the system on at all when I start the car. There doesn't appear to be a dual/synchronize function for the front heating/cooling. I had this feature in my previous 535i and it seems like an oversight that would have been very inexpensive to provide. It's annoying to have to control each side independently.


poor location - obstructs drivers vision
It does not come toward the driver nearly enough for someone who is over 6 ft.
The past 3 cars I have owned had 'auto-sense wipers'.  This was a mechanism that was always on.  In the BMW I have to always turn on the auto-wipers which then makes it not auto at all.  It would be like having auto headlights that I had to turn on every time.  Where is the auto in that?  And I need new blades after a month????
I have turned the auto locks off.  I have had other cars where park would unlock all doors; or turning the car off would unlock all doors.  This is not the case in the BMW.  AND the only mechanism  to unlock doors can only be operated while in the car.
clock is small and difficult to see; especially while driving.
Camera is low grade  and is not centered properly;  Everything is at an angle in reverse.
The entire mechanism is either broken or poorly designed.  The early collision while set on the 'early' setting doesn't appear until about 10 ft from hitting something AND the only warning is a sign in the head's up display.  If a person is looking forward; they are aware of the collision approaching.  A display in the same view is pointless.  There is no sound. EVER. The last 3 cars I have had worked well; not the BMW.
: The radio frequency is off and am getting layered sounds.  For example; if I am listening to a classical pianist playing Beethoven on a concert grand piano; it sounds as if they are using a electronic keyboard with the chorus engaged.  This is ONLY with the radio.  I have compared using a disc; an ipod; and so forth.  The others were beautiful; but not the radio.  The problem is only a serious musician probably cares are hears these drastic differences.
: This is not a huge issue; but the temperature displayed in the control is significantly off of reality.  I have a setting of 68 degrees to maintain 71 degrees .  The same with cooling.  I need to set the car at 64 to maintain 68.
can only see bottom 2/3s of display. To see entire display; seat has to be adjusted too low for driving comfort.
scroll wheel takes too long. Voice command and writing sensor have helped in this version; but can still be difficult. Looking up points of interest  if you do not have address takes too long and is not intuitive.
with packages in my hand it is very heavy to close and now my hands are dirty and my car has fingerprints all over the trunk
It takes a long time to use the BMW connected app with the car -- I listen to Pandora radio and it freezes or doesn't load.
Android integration  is just buggy.
Driver's side door.
: Inasmuch as I am only 5feet 2inches; I would have liked the height adjustment to go a little higher.

Hard to plug in while in the driver's seat
A plastic piece fell out of the door. Two months after purchase 
Pain in the but to clean alloy wheels
Can't see in the sunlight with the top down.  I just listen to sati lite radio
Cup holder is snapped into glovebox and than must be inserted into console.  I do not use because it is not convenient.
: Disconnects with Blue tooth intermittently
Plastic panel labeled 'air bag' directly under and posterior to glove box is hanging down on the right side about 1/4 inch. Will not snap back up like it probably should
The system just has a hard time recognizing my voice commands.  Not all the time; and many times it works just fine.  But; there have been a few occasions where it did not recognize my speech so I am reporting it.  This problem is insignificant and I think with more use; it would get better.  This problem has absolutely no impact on my positive feelings about the car.
: the dealer added the Sirius radio option to the vehicle upon delivery.  It took the dealership almost 2 weeks to install it correctly.  In fact; they had to replace the radio in the process because they damaged it while attempting to install the Sirius system.  The dealership did not know how to hookup the pre-wired Sirius.  The service dept poorly communicated issues and I had to call them routinely to find out the status of the vehicle.  We have purchased  M-series convertibles and never had problems with the dealership/service dept.  this one in Monroe; LA was extremely disappointing even after promising us there would be no issues again.

: Illuminated logo in driver's headrest did not light
Something rattles; unable to consistently replicate and thus dealer cannot fix.
Rear
: Changing channels has to be done with heads up display which does not work with polarized sunglasses and is not a one click feature or with the dial control. Not convenient but this is on a lot of bmw models. Should work like volume simply up and down button on steering wheel to scroll through fav channels.
: Rear seat belts rattle and slap seats when top is down. Clip is needed.
its an interior piece that fits weird but its not a big enough deal to correct right now
chip on gas tank door; don't know if it was always there or something hit it.
probably the normal brightest but I feel its hard to see at night; wish it was brighter
TPM failed; took car in; replaced two sensors; then month later failed again; had to bring in and replace one more sensor. Seems to work now.
biggest issue is with iPhone -- sometimes can't sync playlist; sometimes it won't let you change tracks with car; etc. Dealer tells me its iPhone not BMW and if i reboot iPhone sometimes it helps.  At the same time I have an Infiniti QX60 and somehow that car manages to sync perfectly -- never had an issue...
As previously noted.
Problem with touch open/close the door.  Problem with 'foot wand' to open trunk.  Will need to use the key to open/close the door and open trunk.
When touching the door handle the door occasionally will not open or lock.  I will need to use the key.
When taking the car to the carwash; it's easy for the attendants to leave black marks in the carpet.  Not sure if from the shoe sole or not.

always looks like there is black on front passenger seat.  My daughter sits in the seat every day to and from school with a dark uniform skirt on.  It is ever-present.
It just seems the pedals could be another 2' apart.
It seems the center console should have been deeper; another 2-4' would go a long way to adding storage space.
Most cups are tall enough to wedge under the dash; making it difficult to place or remove the cup/bottle from the holder.  Just seems there could be another 0.5' of space from the dash.
Stated prior. : The engine seems choppy at times; as though the automatic transmission is stuck in the wrong gear.  It is hard to explain; but it seems jumpy/choppy.
As stated before; seems jumpy/choppy at times.  I can't pinpoint an exact circumstance; but it seems confused of what gear to shift to at times. : The engine seems choppy at times; as though the automatic transmission is stuck in the wrong gear.  It is hard to explain; but it seems jumpy/choppy.
aerodynamic moulding  is loose/misaligned along bottom of door
road noise from tires and pavement
system shows incorrect location : navigation does not display correct location on map
I don't know if it is specifically the door panels; but whenever driving the car squeaks/creaks as the body of the car shifts from all the various forces placed on it by driving
USB PORT IS ONLY GOOD TO CHARGE PHONE AND WON'T LET YOU PULL MUSIC TO THE RADIO.
The wind sounds really loud with the sunroof open
Sunroof would open easily but it would get to two inches of closing and back up.  Wouldn't close
It should be a more gentle shut off and start up.  You can't hear or feel it when a Toyota Prius turns off and restarts.  A bmw should have the same sensation
When windows are foggy; cannot see at all for about 5 to 10 minutes even when defrost is blowing on high - windows are not clear enough to drive.  Have experienced twice; not enough to take to dealership.

: The trunk suppose to open at a kick Sometimes it works; sometimes it takes a couple of times
: On the driver side of the door the paint is chipping a little bit Back to my old car;hate to say it but the paint was much stronger
When I am in a garage or any underground structure their is no reception at all.My old BMW never had that problem.One would  Think with a 2015; it would be even better than the older model not the reverse
If I try to say the name it gives me the wrong name to dial; unless I know the # of the person IE;1 Smith; who can remember what # coincides with what name
I had a tutorial at the dealership; one thing I forgot Is their a way to make the seat higher; hope so
: It's not a problem per say; but an observation  When sitting at a red light ; the engine starts for a second and it kind of scares n Me I don't know if it's normal
This is our third 3-series BMW and these side view mirrors are awful- size; shape; piece that mounts mirror to body is bulky and obtrusive.
the accelerator together with the break should be moved a little to the right; I feel like sitting twisted a little
the influenced location should be higher
Lower quality than my MDX; easy to get dirty and hard to clean.
Noticeably noisy at moderate speed.
The main problem is that it won't connect with my iPhone automatically when I enter my car.
Hard to follow directions.
Frequent appearance of white spots.
It does not seem to be effective.
Lightly burnt oil smell.
Excessively noisy at idle.
Gas mileage lower than expected.
The headrest does not seem to have a variety of adjustments relatively to other brand of cars
belt gets tangled when pulling out of holder - not easy to undo


: Voice recognition system is almost unuseable.


Door Locks automatically lock after certain amount of seconds.  I still need to figure out if I can override this - not something a simple as pressing a button to unlock other doors.
These seats are not built for someone with a smaller torso length -I feel as if I constantly need to sit up and try to peer over the hood.  I'm 5'4' - that is not really short.  I do not know how someone any smaller could drive this - I feel as if I need to sit on a phonebook to properly see out the windshield.

Just seems to never really get cool; unless I switch to max a/c

It's Too Small it does not help at all with the Sun making it hard to drive.
sometimes it sounds like I am drivinga truck
they make a clunk sound when I brake
too  much turning involved
they don't move
they seat belt locks up on the passenger side
need to wipe off when I accidentally touch it with my shoes
i always wonder if my side driver side window is open or crack open coz i could hear wind noise
sound not so good
in comparison w/ my old impala; its louder.
The switch to turn on the cruise control is small and at the bottom of the other switches so I need to look for it to find it while driving.  I had a 2008 Honda Accord and its cruise control was easier to locate.
It takes too long to cool  My 2008 Honda Accord was cooling faster
: HD CHANNELS ON THE RADIO ECHO; FOR EXAMPLE TALK RADIO LIKE NPR.
the phone charger port in the front seat area stopped working approx. 1 month after purchasing the car.  I had to go to BMW service and have it fixed.  They said it was a blown fuse.
: The gas cap door has popped open a few times.  Also; both side view mirrors retain water after washing and then are I drive; the water pours out from the mirror and runs down the side the car leaving watermarks on a newly washed car.  This happens every time with this car but I have never had this happen before with any other car.  It's a very annoying defect!

The air conditioning system does not cool the car sufficiently.

gas and brake pedals a little too close for me
Fuse may have blown

The dye of my genes comes off on the seats and I constantly have to clean them
: Navigation
Not user friendly.
I don't think the system is user friendly. Should be easier to find addresses without having to enter the state and city - for example; your phone does it by automatically using your location. The first step in the nav entry requires me to enter the state - which 99.9% of the time is not going to change. Also it is slow to adjust if it is forced to 'recalculate' routes. And it is difficult to anticipate the next direction; for example; if the directions require making a left turn immediately after a right turn; the system should warn you to get into the left lane before you make the right turn.
Oyster color shows dirt and is difficult to clean.  Same issue with the light color on door handles. This color is aesthetically pleasing but an unfortunate; impractical choice.
Dents were noticed after delivery.Dealership was contacted and repair arrangements were scheduled. It appears that door dents take place in the parking lot where cars are parked very close to each other.
Poor quality. Velcro is used to keep mats in place but it doesn't work. with the extreme heat here in Arizona; velcro isn't adhesive any more and mats won't stay in place.
: The heater/air conditioner blower motor always automatically comes on when you start the vehicle. I find it very annoying and from what I understand; only the dealership can change that.
I 'can' make it work; but often it's just easier to navigate the menu system rather than use voice commands. I'm born in the UK and have an English accent with clear diction; but as I now live in the US; perhaps it's an American English issue in some cases. Although my girlfriend; a native Californian; also has the occasional issue and rarely uses it for the same reason. In general it's not an issue and hasn't spoilt my overall opinion of the vehicle.
I have an iPhone 6 and paring generally works ok. However; on more than one occasion it has failed to connect when setting off on a journey. I have a work around; which is to switch inputs and then back to bluetooth and it usually connects. I would say it works more often than not and hasn't spoilt my overall opinion of the vehicle.

: It seems that the air conditioning automatically goes on when I start the car and the AC switch is not lit.  I am taking it to the dealer tomorrow for its 3mo. check.
System does not recognize number; especially the number '8'.  When the address begins with an 8; the system quickly changes the screen for navigation the date and time screen for the clock.
Digital display is very small and tends to be obstructed by steering wheel; making time check difficult while driving.
When using taller containers like protein shaker bottles; they tend to want to scratch the radio console directly above the cup holders when you are removing the container from the holder.
Small dust particle embedded in paint.

Intermittant
: The brakes can be screechy; especially in very cold weather
BOTH THE WEATHER AND THE NORMAL FLOOR MATS FOR THE DRIVER SIDE ARE NOT LONG ENOUGH TO COVER THE AREA - IN THE EVENT THE SEAT IS ALL THE WAY BACK - THE WAY I HAVE THE SEAT ADJUSTED.





Hard to control constant use vs quick  use
The wiper controls are unlike those in any other car I have driven; and are NOT self-obvious. : The car's controls are not self-obvious.
Doesn't always cancel when it should  : The car's controls are not self-obvious.
I have no idea where it is.
How is a new BMW driver to fund the 'unfold side mirrors' control when it is not lighted or labeled?
Why 2 step shut-down?  Once locked car and was surprised engine was running when I came back.
Folding side mirror control - not lighted or labeled...difficult to use at night. Radio controls - why does the radio channel not come on with volume.  Why is it a 2-step process ot listen to the radio?



: Front window defrost makes the car too hot.
I previously owned a 500 series. The 400 series rides more like sports car. The 500 series more like a sedan. I realize the difference but I like the car
Iphone will not always automatically connect/pair
Hard to adjust unless I stop and get out to do it.  I am right handed and what I need to use is up high on the left side of my head .
: I always have to have my air conditioning on to keep my windows from fogging up.
I am not sure what is squeaking or rattling.  It appears to be on the passenger side of the car.
I can't tell exactly where it is coming from but it appears to be on the passenger side of the car.  The trunk rattles and appears to be the compartments not fitting snug so they are shifting around and are very noisy.
Front Driver Side Reflector fell off. I think it fell into the compartment behind the reflector. Will know more when I take it in for repair.
When push button ignition is pushed to turn off car; audio does not turn off with  pushing ignition button. You must take foot off brake and then press ignition button again to turn off audio. I do not know how to change this. I want audio to turn off when I turn off the engine!
: can't  GET WIPERS TO WORK INTERMITTENTLY
I EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY GETTING OUT OF MY SEAT
don't know
Don't know
When wearing polarized sunglasses; I need to tilt my head about 45 degrees to the right to see the display. I am aware of; and have operated; the control setting that controls 'rotation' of the HUD; which I understood to be to correct the issue with polarization. However; I could detect no change or improvement in visibility between the limits of the rotation adjustment. Don't know if this reflects a problem with the setting or with my operation of it.
Have only used the navigation system a few times; so operator error may be involved in my experience. But - I've noticed a few frustrating differences  in the BMW navigation vs others I am more familiar with [e.g. Magellan; Google]:  the voice prompts do not give enough advance notice of a turn ;  In other systems both the voice and display communicate the name of the street on which the next turn should be made. BMW doesn't - at least not that I have noticed. This causes me confusion about the correct route when there are several potential streets close together.  In other systems; the communication about an approaching turn takes the form of [1. 'prepare to turn left' when within a few hundred feet or so of the turn; and 2. a distinct beep [not enough space to complete my comment]
The storage compartment is shallow and irregularly shaped; making it virtually useless for storing anything more than a pair of glasses.
smells like stale dirty air - always keep my vent deodorizer in to help.
There is a small scratch on the back bumper that was there when I got the car. My salesperson offered to have it repaired right away and I said it was ok to let it be and repair it if someone else scraped the bumper at a later time. He agreed to do so and was very nice about it.
Already explained that it is a very light color and any dirt or even material like jeans will transfer to the seat. I think it probably should be sealed with something to prevent this.
The leather seats are a beautiful light color called 'Oyester' and they show every little bit of dirt or color. In fact; the first or second time I drove the car in jeans; I could see blue on the seat that transferred from my jeans. I have to clean it with a leather cleaner and if wearing jeans; put a towel on the seat. Should be sealed; possibly.

There are too many buttons w/o explanations on just how to understand the heating and cooling system. Everything works it's just difficult to get used to

Seat belt is twisted and  not retracted.

There is no front seat passenger side storage space.
Inconvenient that the sun visor is not automatic. Sometimes sticks. Side passenger mirror does not tilt to allow for better viewing when backing up and parking.
When the windows are down there is a 'fluttering' noise that is hard on my ear drums.

has a plug in device that takes up room
: TWO SMALL DENTS IN THE PASSENGER DOOR
: Hands free truck opening  doesn't always open the trunk.
The fuel cap works fine; but I can't figure out why sometimes I can't close properly the fuel door. It should be as easy as open it; but it isn't the case with my car. Because of this I have to leave the gas station with the fuel door semi-open; which is never a good idea.
: When I connect an external device via the USB interface to play music; such as my iPhone; the audio level  have to be adjusted higher than when I'm listening radio. It's absolutely annoying and uncomfortable to switch from a multimedia source to a satellite radio source without first turning the audio volume down; something you won't remember to do in most cases. Audio levels should be adjusted accordingly to avoid user discomfort and a potential distraction that can cause accidents.
The seat belt retraction is decent. The problem lies in the top mounting where the belt runs through the slot... sometimes the seat belt gets stuck there.

FM 97.7 is always staticy even when I am in Seattle.
After a few tries and having the system misinterpret; it's not worth using anymore. I just use the physical controls instead.



: Driver window occasionally squeeks going up and down

Does not recognize certain address's ; for example; when I enter my business address; it sends me to another city 40 miles away.
Front seats have extenders for the legs that makes the seat longer. Extender on the driver side does not close all the way.





WENT BACK TO DEALER AND SALES GUY RELEASED AIR IN THE TIRE THINKING THAT WOULD ALLEVIATE THE ISSUE. IT DIDNT
it was very bothersome but it resolves on its own and occurs occasionally : the breaks make a screeching noise when I step on the brakes each time. It is very loud and it started approximately about a month after my purchase.


: The stereo/entertainment system is horrible. Below average sound and controls for a $50;000 car!
: The stereo/entertainment system is horrible. Below average sound and controls for a $50;000 car!


The heating/cooling system turns on every single time you turn on the car no matter what. This is very annoying. It is forced upon you. I have no idea what BMW was thinking with doing this.

too high up on back of head
O2 sensor was bad..indicator came on within 2 hrs after delivery. Needed replacement.

no way to just push a button to go to the next station.
exact same nav system as in previous bmw I leased three years ago.  no upgrades to a difficult system to operate.  Years behind the Jeep I own.

top part of seat hits celing whne pushed forward to let rear passengers in or out

: WIPERS: WIPERS

SEIRIUS RADIO PROBLEM
: There is no snap-in adapter available for my Samsung Galaxy S5; in fact; the latest adapter only supports the S4 model. There is already an S6; making BMW two phone models behind. I believe this is also true of the iPhone. Also; there is no BMW Connected Spotify app for smartphones other than the iPhone. Lastly; when connected via Bluetooth; the title of the track that is streaming from my phone will occasionally freeze on both the navigation and dashboard screens; while I will still be able to advance to the next track; the title of the first played song remains. As popular as BMW is; the company should really try to stay on top of technology and the speed with which it moves; especially in today's world where we are  dependent upon out smartphones.  Regarding the sound systems; while I don't have any particular issues with the sound system; there should be an additionally upgrade with a better sub-woofer.
: When starting the car; the heating/air-conditioning is turned on at default and set to the most recent temperature setting. This is especially irritating when I do not require any comfort adjustments and have the windows open; only to realize several minutes later that the heat is on. This happens even if the heating/air-conditioning is OFF prior to shutting off the car.
Vehicle had unnecessary holes in the bumper drilled for a front license plate.  This is not required in PA and the vehicle had been brought in from out of state.  License plate installation had also caused paint scratches in the area.  This was all fixed by the dealer after I pointed it out.

the fuel door would not release when pushed upon.  took several tries before it would open.  I thought I was not going to be able to get fuel that day.
Too many steps to complete a simple task.  Too many levels to get through to enter an address or POI. The icons for options should just be words.  So I don't have to click on the icon to see what the option is.
: Very rarely; the BlueTooth will not sync up; which doesnt allow me to control my audio library through the car head unit. This usually resolves itself after some time... but occasionally; I need to select the artist/song via the phone itself.
The tire pressure sensor was defective and caused an air leak in the front driver side.
Misinterprets commands
Trunk opens just fine. It is automatic; sometimes; the door starts to close automatically though when I have not pressed anything.  Could simply be operator error though; and reading the manual to know the tricks might solve this.
As silly as it sounds; I am not confident about opening the shade on my moonroof when I am in a car wash because I'm afraid I'll open the whole roof.  I wish the icons were more clear so I could open the shade with confident so that my 11 month old sun could enjoy watching the water splash on the car ceiling....silly; yes; but bmw is all about pleasurable driving experience; yes?
I don't know if I would consider it a problem really; its just that sometimes when I break  as I am going down a steep grade it automatically downshifts to a gear that makes the RPMs sore and while I think it may actually be doing exactly as it should; the engine sound revs so dramatically that it is is a bit unsettling to the pleasant ride.
: wind noise around both front doors/ windows
The system is wired but was not available on delivery and has not yet been available as per sevice department comments
: The weather and digital clock feature on the screen keeps going on an off from no weather information  to weather information for long periods of time ..off and on...I was told that this is controled by a service not generated from BMW.
: The weather and digital clock feature on the screen keeps going on an off from no weather information  to weather information for long periods of time ..off and on...I was told that this is controled by a service not generated from BMW.
the switch doesn't work.  Shade/moonroof will not open.  It worked fine for first two months
There is not enough vertical clearance for even a 16 oz travel mugs.
the center headrest in the back seat blocks my line of vision. it looks like it should come off but i cant get it off.
only the very top portion opens so there is around 2' of depth to store thing; the rest of the center console is wasted space.
the flat compartment directly in behind the front cup holes is too small to hold anything; it doesn't even fit a credit card.
IT'S NOT A BIG PROBLEM.  JUST ANNOYING THAT SOMETIMES IT'S SLOW TO RESPOND AND MISUNDERSTANDS MY COMMANDS.
it is slow to connect to the phone when the car is first started but connects with no problem.
It appears that the front plastic chips or flakes very easy and more than normal.


Windows were smeared and tires were below pressure when car was delivered .
Wheels are out of alignment. Car pulls to right.
: Windows were smeared and tires were below pressure when car was delivered .
Car was not prepped for devliery completely. Windows were smeared and some clear protective sheets protecting interior were not removed when car was delivered.

: DRIVER SIDE MIRROR SCRATCHED.
: BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM DOES NOT ACTIVATE UNTIL 30MPH.

TRIED NAVAGATING TO HOME ON BRIARFIELD WAY.  ROUTE WAS INDIRECT.
: DRIVER HEADREST CATCHES ON ROOF WHEN SEAT PULLED FORWARD.
Since the moment I received the car; I noticed a lot of tiny scratches on the car. They are very hard to see; but in certain light; it is noticeable. Maybe it is because the car is black metallic; but the car shouldn't have so many surface scratches. After taking it to the dealership; they did a full detail; and this made it worse. I don't think they realized that having even a tiny piece of sand on the towel they use to dry the car can cause those surface scratches and they should have used a brand new towel.
Often blue tooth cannot connect to my iPhone 6; music doesn't play right away or at all. IPhone 6 seems to have caused issues. After BMW m4 had software upgrade; it fixed the issue.
The navigation system is hard to understand. When putting in directions; the map is all over the place; you cannot tell where you are going; or what road you are on. If it wasn't for voice command; there is no way to tell looking at the map. It should be much more clear.
Rattling is occurring at all times; do not have time to go to the dealership again.

Strong rattle noise behind cup holder and radio face plate.


This noise occurs very rarely; but when it does it is within the limited slip differential gears in the rear-end.  Apparently this is a specific differential only found in the M-series cars  and this occasional noise is reported to be normal per the dealer.  The dealer's service department advised that BMW has addressed this problem by formulating a special type of lubricant that - when changed per the normal maintenance schedule - is sufficient maintenance for this differential.
Rattle appears to come from the clear cover on the dashboard. The sound can be stopped by touching the panel to keep it from rattling.
The arm rest needs to be left open in order to use it and not keep my iPhone in the location.
Have to Siam to close.
Roof molding keeps lifting.
Appears to be coming from windows.
LIGHTS WERE ORIENTED TOO HIGH AND WAS SHINING INTO OTHER VEHICLES.
HEADLIGHTS WERE AIMED TOO HIGH. I ENDED UP GETTING INTO AN ACCIDENT 3 DAYS AFTER PURCHASE DURING A RAINY DAY. POOR VISIBILITY DUE TO IMPROPERLY ADJUSTED LIGHTS.  IT TOOK 3 WEEKS TO GET REPLACEMENT PARTS.
KEYWORD SEARCH NOT UP TO DATE COMPARED TO IPHONE MAP SEARCH; I.E. RESTAURANTS OR DESTINATIONS. VOICE NAVIGATION DOESNT ALWAYS INTEPRET INFO CORRECTLY. I WILL USE MY IPHONE FOR NAVIGATION MOST OF THE TIME. IT TAKES TOO LONG TO INPUT ADDRESS.
WHEN U COME TO A STOP OR IN TRAFFIC; IT STAYS IN 3RD GEAR AND SOMETIMES STUDDERS BEFORE DOWN SHIFTING TO 2ND.
When temperature is cold; less than 40F; there is a an annoying buzzing sound from the dash area to the right side.
The parking brake shoe on the back driver's side wheel came loose and had to be refitted.

Primarily noisy tires. Some wind noise as well.
Vibration during high revving acceleration.
The trunk has recessed grips inside to pull it down;but it is necessary to push very hard on the trunk exterior to close.
The two areas on the hood and one on the trunk are alike.  They are dull; round spots.  I suspect that they could be from moisture or air under the protective film applied to the car for transport.  The other two imperfections are scratches.
I have another high performance car and in comparison the amount of brake dust produced from the M4 is excessive.
The exhaust has an excessively strong odor.
have to slam the hood to get it to sit properly
AM reception is poor. AM audio is often dull; noisy. One of my right speakers is 'buzzy'.
One of the speakers on the right side is 'buzzy'; maybe 'blown'.
: It seems like after I turn off the AC; leave the car; and come back; even hours later; the AC is still on. Only after I turn the temp way up; does it actually go off.
A lot of force is needed to shift into revers.
: Ipod connectivity via USB seems to be sketchy. Often when switching modes from Radio to USB  Ipod connectivity is lost; and also sometimes when switching to another song; it's lost as well.  Sometimes it works perfectly.  I've tried to determine if it's related to loss of charge on the Ipod; but does not appear to be.
: I'm a fairly tall driver; so my seat is pretty far back from the steering wheel; yet the seat belt is still so far back it's difficult to reach to put on.  It's not clear if there is a device that is supposed to retain it in a more accessible position or not.  There is release for the seat back that sometimes catches it; but if it's supposed to hold it there; it is poorly designed.
Can't really isolate noises; but did notice the car has a couple of creaks and pops at low speeds already.  I know it's a car that minimizes weight in every way; so some of this is expected. I'm not complaining about it; but rather just noting it.
See answer to previous question.
When you fold the driver seat up so that a rear passenger can exit; it hits the visor.
: My maps seem to be shown only in night mode now ; I have tried re selecting day mode but seems to me as locked in night mode colors

Bluetooth music streaming via Pandora does not update the artist title and album title on the screen when songs change.
IT turned out to be the wiring harness. It was repaired within the 2nd week of ownership.
It's a software issue between my iPhone 6+ and my BMW where the music does play correctly.
Almost like a hollow thud sound while driving over the smallest of bumps
Steering feels numb and too assisted.  this is probably due to the electric power steering.
Rattle from within driver side door panel...intermittent but annoying
Gear shifts are a laggy during cold start operation.

listting an address like you would write it does not appear to work 
The idrive controller at times did not work and needed to be replaced.  It started on cold days but did at other times as well.  without this working I had to use voice controls which were not as efficient.
Tire noise just going to wait til the run flats are bald then replace

Light clicking sound seems to come from the vicinity of the center screen; and generally occurs on rough roads and over bumps; usually at low to moderate speeds.

LT Headlamp is aimed lower than RT when low beams are on.
My 335i has the factory installed M Performance Brakes so being that it's the bigger brake kit and a European car I expected brake dust but the amount thus far is a bit more than I expected and the way it builds up on everything is unfortunate.
It seems that when I turn OFF the AC; it still blows cold air.  Not sure if its really OFF.
THE TOW HOOK COVER ON THE FRONT BUMPER DOES NOT FIT CORRECTLY
: USB CONNECTION WOULD NOT WORK WITH AN IPHONE ON IOS 8
AT 2600 MILES I RECEIVED A DRIVETRAIN MALFUNCTION LIGHT; INDICATING LOW POWER MODE; TOOK CAR TO THE DEALER; THEY RESET FAULT CODES; BUT WERE UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE WHAT TRIGGERED THE LIGHT. THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN AT 3500 MILES; TOOK THE CAR TO A DIFFERENT DEALER WHO FOUND THE CODE SET BY A TURBO WASTEGATE ISSUE; BUT FOUND THAT THE WASTEGATE WAS FUNCTIONING NORMALLY AT THAT TIME. THEY RESET THE FAULT CODES BUT DID NOT REPLACE ANY PARTS. : CAR HAS SET ITSELF BACK INTO 'QC1' DELIVERY MODE TWICE; LIMITING ENGINE PERFORMANCE.
This particular model that has 'baseline' leather seats seems to be poorly done. The upholstry sits loose in some areas and seats are a bit uncomfortable. This is not the case with other line models that BMW makes.
The instrument panel light at the lower part of the panel where the odometer is went out after about 3 months of use. It used to flicker sometimes but used to go out for a long time but suddenly come on at certain times. It was also fixed under warranty.
The glove box had a wiring harness inside that was loose and made a low rattle that was annoying. This was fixed by the dealer under warranty.
: A draft
Doesn't open well when swaying leg under trunk which should open automatically.
front headrests are too high and cannot be lowered.

When using keyless entry; its inconvenient to have to get in the car to unlock another door because the lock control in is in the middle of the dash.

it comes across the screen during cold weather to say that I have low battery power and I must charge my battery.  When I called the dealership they said that I have to drive without my accessories on which include my heat. A new car and they say that I have to drive without my HEAT on and this is normal for cold weather. At the second month I got a warning that there was a drive train problem and it had to be serviced.  They had to put a new part in to fix the problem
i feel like I have to really slam on them to break

Port would be better if it was by or under the radio because the arm rest won't close. If it does then the phone loses connection.
The screen will not update the artist; title; and picture when the song changes. The phone will not connect if 2 phones are on and connected. I have to turn off one device then turn the Bluetooth off and back on for the car to acknowledge the device I want to use.
IT TAKES MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS FOR SENSOR TO WORK AND MOST OF THE TIME IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK
BUTTON FOR DOOR LOCK/UNLOCK IS IN CENTER COUNSLE AND INCONVENIENT IT SHOULD BE ON DRIVER DOOR WHERE THE WINDOW CONTROLS ARE. TRUNK LATCH IS ALSO IN AN AWFUL LOCATION.  HARD TO GET TO EASILY; SHOULD BE WHERE IT IS ON OTHER CARS BY THE SEAT CONTROLS
BUTTON SHOULD BE ON AN EASIER ACCESSIBLE PLACE ON THE STEARING WHEEL OR ON DASH
MATERIAL USED AROUND DOOR HANDLES SEEMS DIFFERENT THAN AROUND PANELS AND SOILS EASILY
Trunk mysteriously opens on its own






Seats are uncomfortable.  Period.

gives you the stupidest routes...incredibly stupid
a lag can be felt - not what I expected out of the legendary 335i
I experience the problem when trying to access my music and also when trying to make a call from my contacts list. Sometimes people have a hard time hearing me when I'm on hands free.
Small condensation mark on the inside of my driver side headlight that is always there.
For the price point; I wouldn't have expected to hear so much wind noise going above 45mph. I'm not sure what is causing this noise exactly; but it might be the side mirrors or windshield.

Front passenger window control did not work at all on delivery. I brought it back to the dealer and they wanted me to wait 3 months because the part was on 'back order'. Needless to say I convinced them otherwise and had them swap out the control that same day. It was a faulty window control that should have been checked during quality checks at the facility before shipping.


first gear
has occasionally totally misinterpreted voice commands

The BMW I purchased is not equipped with Comfort Access; however this was never fully explained to be and I unfortunately assumed that since it was equipped with push button start; I also would be able to lock/unlock the doors without taking the fob out of my pocket.  It seems like an assinine feature for BMW to provide push-button start without also being able to keep the key in my pocket to lock/unlock it... so much for a 'luxury' feature.  The Nissan I sold had the keyless entry and push button start... and it cost MUCH less.
The blue from jeans comes off on the seats. I have been able to clean them.


: trunk release is in a hard to reach location
the door handle must be pulled 2 times to unlock the driver or passenger door when the engine is turned off.  No way to override this.  Very annoying. No beeping sound when the doors are locked from the fob.
seat belt buckle is very low between the front seats and the console.  Hard to find and latch. The back seat buckle moves around and is difficult to find and latch.  Passengers have commented on how hard it is to find and use.  Also; hard to buckle in a booster seat for a child for the same reasons and above.
sometimes when pushing the park button the car does not o into park properly.
blue tooth issues when wifi is on; it stops the music.  Blue tooth drops from time to time. : Nothing except blue tooth issues
Difficult to tell if doors are locked or not since lights don't flash
Poor location. Should be more than one spot. Also does not charge the phone when connected.
Don't use since it does not work well
Pairing is manual most if the time. Contacts don't sync. Messages don't come up.
Can't seem to get seats set to stay
The external sensor  has never worked for me. I always have to open with my hand.
The scroll dial is in a bad location . My dog often rides in the front seat and he will bump the dial and buttons often changing selections with his movements. The navigation controls should be moved up to the dashboard.   I find the icons and steps required to make selections very confusing; not intuitive. The voice commands are spotty at best and never work when I need them the most .



Dealer replaced module in the on-board entertainment system. Everything's been fine since.

Change the Senosr it  took one month to figure out i have to tell the dealer ship how to fix it : only the tire pressure sensor
Voice recognition system is bad need improve
When my kids or my wife try to open the truck from outside; must of the times they can not open the truck; so I have to use the remote control or push the interior release button; to open the trunk.
I was probably used to drive my former car ; the lights were far more bight; even with the Fog lights on the lights are not bright enough; I should not go with the basic lights; probably the xenon package should be my best choice; I call the dealer to see if I can request the xenon kit to be installed at extra cost; but they sales person; told me that it can not be done; as well he mentioned that there is an after market option; but it will avoid the car warranty.
The rain sensor works in odd way; seems to work the first 5 minutes; and after more time; the wipers just stop; so I have to switch back to manual
there is an Application for iphone to communicate with the car; it never works; is staying trying to communicate; and send an communication error
I don't really know how to adjust; the lumbar support; the model showed to me to deal had the electric controls for the seat; but the car delivered; did not have the controls; I noticed it after sign all the paper work and the car was delivered. When I asked to the sale person; the price was subject to change; because of the negotiated discounts; I really regret to accepted the car without the electric driver seat; and  the garage opener; that I see in the test drive. So the discount was good; but I missed some gadgets
The way to set the seat up; is to pull up your body and pull the holder at the same time; so is not easy lo adjust the height properly; I think even in a manual seat the adjustment could be better with other kind of mechanism.
There is a function to program the car for specific time to; I'm assuming for hot days;or cool days;   in the electronic menu display; but is not clear how it works; as well the front controls; seems to be independent at all times; I could not find the way to sync both zones yet.
The cup holders are not shaped properly; is difficult to place an Starbucks type  of coffee paper glass; or any other larger glass
The glue used for the attachments seems to be low quality; and after few weeks; the OEM all weather mat on the driver side; lost the adherence and moves around.
The door locks being in the center of the dashboard is odd. It is not convenient for exiting the vehicle.


returned vehicle for repair Wed April 3 2015; was told problem was need to reboot system; was not the case; and was told factory notified and a new system to be installed. Was given a nice loaner car; but as of today; Monday April9; no word about when cr will be ready
no further comment
I got a flat tire within first 2 months. likely a nail; so not a defect
: Too little road feedback and a tad vague on center. The car knows when you're not paying attention and is eager to set a new course. It broke me of texting and reaching for things. Trying to get the radio to do what I want has to wait for straight road.
Looked at several cars at dealer; they all have it. See it on other makes also.
: Shifted itself repeatedly from D to P after restart with a long nonsense message on the screen about 'Optimizing Safety' composed by someone not having English as their first language. Glad I wasn't crossing Train Tracks. This was on my inclined driveway; pulling into the garage.
There was one ding on right rear back panel on delivery. Dealer had me bring the vehicle back a few days later and the ding was repaired.
poor balancing  of the tire; created vibration when driving.
cushioning of the seats not as soft as previous models; kind of hard seats.

Difficult to reset; with explaining present situation of tires





this is located in the center console and limits space for anything else. the 2011 version of this car also had a usb port in the glove box which would have been great to have in the 2015 as well.
it takes long to find/pair with my ipod  and my iphone in my pocket. sometimes it won't even connect and i need to unplug and replug the ipod into the usb port; and/or manually re-pair the iphone via bluetooth.
Bad crankshaft position sensos

i did not notice the smell the day i picked it up but believe this was because it was running.  the next morning i noticed a moldy wet clothing sort of smell when i turned the ac on.  it continues nearly 3 months later but only when i first start the car.  its not as noticeable after 5 - 10 minutes








Excessive muffler sound on acceleration
defrost is either on high or low; does maintain a constant temp; very annoying
This is my 4th Z ; you have to reach across from the drivers side to the passenger side; in all these years with all the technology; I would think BMW could master the cup holder. It's the design; nothing the dealer can do.
TOO MUCH LAG TIME IN LOCK RELEASE
inaccurate; IMPERSONAL; AND WAY TOO MUCH TIME INPUTTING THE ADDRESS WITH THE ROTATING WHEEL CONTROL. : THE BMW NAVI SYSTEMS DO NOT SAY 'TURN LEFT ON CHAPMAN AVENUE'...THEY JUST SAY'TURN LEFT IN 500 FEET'. I CAN GET A GARMIN GPS THAT WILL ANNOUNCE ALL OF THE STREET NAMES; ETC. NOT JUST 'TURN LEFT; VEER RIGHT' ETC
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE SPELLED OR DICTATED EXACTLY. IT TOOK ME 10 MINUTES TO FIND 'DISNEYLAND'.I HAD TO TRY WAY TOO MANY NAMES...IT WAS TOO PROPER.
HAVING AN EXTERNAL 'PLUG IN' STYLE CUP HOLDER IS LUDICROUS FOR A 50K VEHICLE. IT IS EVIDENT THAT IT WAS OVERLOOKED AND THE PLUG IN CUP HOLDER WAS AN AFTER THOUGHT

I heard the noise when I test drove the car; the sales person said they will be able to fix 'don't worry about that'
I continue to hear a rattle behind the driver seat. The noise seems worse when the outside temperature is cold. I have taken it in 3 times. Once I was told that these noises are normal due to the rear axil settling. The dealer had a technician ride with me who also heard the noise but they still were unable to fix. Suggested if it continues for me to bring it back when another person returned from vacation.
Awkward having to pull door storage device down and put item back in while driving. Bad design.

If the cup holder is empty it rattles when going over ruff pavement. Will remove when becoming too annoying.

Hole in the condensing line allowed all freon to leak out. The hole was not from impact with rock or other object according to the technician.
: while in the vehicle unable to unlock passenger door. I have to reach over and open from the inside.
I had a hard time navigating the system when trying to pick a location and start navigation. Also; the voice commands giving me directions were very low tone and I could not find where or how to turn that up.
Once programmed at dealership; I was unable to reprogram to my specific desire.
: Screen went blank.  Problem corrected itself after car had been turned off for a few hours.
Difficult to get different memory settings to match to two different keys. Memory gets deleted
The cup holder is under the center console so armrest has to be up to access.
: This is more of a personal preference comment.  I find the LUMBAR SUPPORT  in the passenger seat uncomfortable due to the manner that the headrest protrudes forward.  The headrest is hard and can not be adjusted to tilt back.  I am able to use a seat cushion to buffer the space between my back and seat.  I do find the seat in general uncomfortable because of the forward design of the headrest.

Cup holder are in the center console in an ackward location to use.   The other one protrudes into the passenger seat and is only useful when there is no passenger.
Nothing to keep seat belt in place; so it slides behind the seats when not in use.  Very difficult to reach around & search for the belt to use.
70 degrees isn't 70 degrees when clicking the auto button with the AC light on and dial on blue.
Pairing/syncing with music player frequently experiences problems and information is not properly synced. Whenever this happens; the music player/app on the phone will not respond to the skip/forward buttons in the car.
Usually happens when it is humid or hot outside and the AC is on inside the vehicle. I use the windshield wipers to clear them as well as select the defrost settings; but it doesn't clear very successfully.
the usb is located under the center console.  I have to either squash the connecting wire or leave center console up while using media device.   The other USB location is inside of a closed area and the usb holder is a tight fit under the dash area.  Not good area.   Need more than 2 ports.  I would like to see a better location for the usb port. : ALready explained previously.  Have not tried ipad. Didnt know ipad could be used.
IT takes a while to connect and I especially cannot connect to Pandora even when plugged in to usb.  Pandora should pick up on bluetooth connectivity.
IT tends to be a slow when re engaging af a red to green light.  But after a few seconds; it is fine.  Just more patience on my part. : already explained previously
IT ONLY DOES THIS SOMETIMES; ITS NOT A MAJOR PROBLEM; I THINK THAT IT JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ME.
poor connection to an android phone
I have a hard time seeing the middle controls above the steering wheel because the steering wheel obstructs the view of the controls. I have tried adjusting the seat and the steering wheel; but there is always some part of the controls that cannot be seen with me having to move around to look for it.
It is in an awkward location. There is not a lot of room for cup holders and there is only a small area to put miscellaneous items. The plug's removal would help that a lot. Plus; if you are using the plug; it is clearly in the way of the cup/cup holders. This makes it slightly dangerous. More space is needed in the middle/front compartment where cup holders and plug are located.
The VRC is inaccurate in interpreting commands. Also; you have to continuously reset your location . Many times the commands you provide are misinterpreted. Navigation to places are misinterpreted. I have stopped using VRC and began typing in places. Many places are either unrecognized or you have to wait a while for the system to recognize the place.
It seems like the system is not up to date. Some places are not recognized that have been in existence for at least 6 months to 1 year. Also; sometimes; the system is off by about 1/4 to 1/2 mile; resulting in an occasional missed exit. Sometimes the route provided on the navigation is not likely to be the quickest route.
Carpet mats are same color as interior and soil easily. The inside door panels get easily scuffed; people's shoes and other items rub against them and they pick up scuffs easily.
The windshield fogs up on the outside lower middle section when the a/c is on. I usually turn the wind shield wipers on and it clears it up.




Several months after getting the car; the horn stopped working. The horn was replaced by BMW. My understanding is that there was a service bulletin about this problem.
'Automatic no hand sensor' takes a while to sense my foot under the trunk to open my trunk automatically.
Much more difficult to operate than a typical Garmin

: Front window heat level can not be adjusted
The headlights just were not bright enough to illuminate dark roads. Much darker than my Lexus. I then bought an over-priced headlight upgrade; which I would call 'adequate' but not great.
Just genrally a lot of wind noise. I thought a number of times I had a window open; but it is just the car.
When I stop the car the parking brake just does not hold the car; even on a level surface. Dealer says ut is normal; but I am not happy with it.
: Navigation system-so bad I stopped using it! totally unacceptable not to let me prview the route or do a 'LIST ' view.  Radio is confusing wrt setting the buttons on the dash and for setting presets. It seems to take presets and then erase them.
I can't figure out how to adjust them to make me comfortable
It just takes quite a few seconds to connect so phone calls start on the cel then switch over to Bluetooth.

Doors are not easily closed. I often find myself making two or three attempts to close the driver's door; most difficult from the inside. You almost have to slam or pull the door very hard. For what i consider a luxury vehicle; I expected the car to have more soft close functionality.
The trunk is as hard to close as the driver and passenger doors. You almost have to slam it to feel like its closed properly.

: none. I will add that the quality of the standard model speakers is well below the quality level of the rest of the car and is not only a disappointment but also a surprise.
a small amount of background noise seems to confuse the system. Turn off engine with car not moving and it works well;perhaps a little slowly. Entertainment muted of course.
Right rear reflector missing.

In cold they are very sensitive and make noise
The unlock button in car in bad location. It should be on driver door not in center of the dashboard. You have to go inside to unlock rear doors.

Not sure where controls are or if I have lumber support
I can't figure out how to adjust it at all not even sure if its manual or not
The fake leather gets dirty very easily.
Carpet should be stain resistant


I can't always close the fuel door.
: Daily
Often the volume turns off when connected to streaming internet radio.  I can fix by switching to radio and back on.  The display does not show the right song.
buttons to control lights too close to emergency button

too small
not enough storage apace and compartments
lightly accelerating
Very cold temperature caused condensed or drained water to freeze the guidepost in the receptacle leaving the door unable to open after multiple attempts including pulling the handle off the inside trunk release cable. Had to use hair dryer to melt the ice and release the door. Had I been away from home this could have been a serious issue. This happened twice over the winter.
Front bumper/grill area had severe vibration rattling. Dealer acknowledged rattle and explained that an unused bracket for a potential headlight washer system was not attached properly and was subsequently removed. Upon return of the vehicle it still rattled; but differently. With the salesman present I found 2 plastic C channel shaped rods about 6 inches long laying in the bottom of the front bumper area loose. The dealer offered no excuse other than they are not part of the assembly so don't worry about it.
Brakes squeak at 20 or below temp until warmed up
Outlet worked 1 time and then stopped
: hard to program favorite stations
The part you hold to open the door was dirty when we got the car and it is not easy to clean.
There is a minor surface blemish about an inch long on the side of a roof panel.  As this is a convertible it is impossible to say if the belimish was there when I took delivery or if it occurred in the first day or two of delivery when I first noticed it.
The sound is noticeable when driving at highway speeds and the convertible top is closed.
On three occasions;. the TPM system indicated that it stopped working only later to resume with no corrective action taken by me.
The system rarely accepts verbal commands for phone or for car controls.
When seated in both the driver and passenger;a protruding box like object is felt. It is uncomfortable when seat over a period time. On road trips; cushion are required. I have spoken to other BMW owners and they notice the same protrusion. I have consulted customer service and they contacted the BMW dealer service manager. He acknowledged the protrusion; but has no been able to remedy. : Aside from from seats; no other seat problem



Trim was scratched and a replacement was ordered and intstalled
Driver seat only returns to memory with the door open?  Our 2011 528i had the same problem
For some reason BMW does not use a sun visor that extends.  So it is of little or no use when turned to cover the drivers window.  It really is a poor design that could be so easily fixed by making the visor extend when turned
Not a very wise system to allow me to lock the car with the gas tank still open; and then refuse to close it.
Very weak breaks compared to my previous car 
heavy to open and close
Car is noisier than my previous BMW; a ragtop


doesn't work very well



Voice commands are mostly misinterpreted when the car is moving with any background noise. System works well when car is stopped or moving at very slow speeds.
I have thought that I had set it for my specific height; etc.; however sometimes when I get back in car the memory seats control do not go back to my specifics correctly; and I have to manually fix it.
: The Bluetooth does not always work. Even though it says connected as soon as I get in my; I frequently have to turn off and on my Bluetooth before I can start listening to music on my phone.
About a month after I bought my new car the light went off telling me I needed to pull over and fill my tires immediately. This scared me immensely but was on my way to a very important meeting and driving on the highway. I called a friend who owned it and took me through the red; yellow; green coloring and said I could make it to Santa Barbara for my meeting but I had to then get it checked. This was WAY too much pressure of an indicator; and I think it should be a little more honest. I still wasn't sure what I was supposed to do by the indicator. Had I not talked to a friend I would be clueless.
Near the bottom of the doors when you get in and or out; scuffs easily.
Street addresses often interpreted as phone numbers. Sometimes first one or two numbers of street address dropped.
The voice recognition system is completely useless.
Limited range; sometimes operates on its own.
Operates without input from driver. Limited range. : Limited range. Operates on its own without input from user.
limited range. Sometimes operates on its own without input from user. : Limited range. Operates on its own without input from user.
Very limited range. Erratic operation. Sometimes operated without prompt from driver.
: Sun visor too small. Rear view mirror and assembly too big; obstructs front view.
hard to ear when radio on
The abnormal suspension noise is experienced only when the road conditions are poor.mi don't notice anything like that on the smooth surfaced roads. It's hard to describe this noise but it's 'clunk; clunk' type of sound
: - clutch pedal is too far from driver compared to gas/break pedal. It would be nice to be able to adjust one or the others.

Disk brake guards either rubbing or a stone gets caught in them causing a brief screech or rubbing sound of metal on stone or metal on metal. I need to take the care in to get it looked at.
Door seals creak from the top where they contact the body. Supposedly this can be corrected by an aftermarket lubricant on them. Gives the impression the roof is creaking. Conditions not known but exacerbated by driving in an uneven parking lot or exiting driveway where chassis flexes.

The paint is incredibly soft and even at 1200 miles or so the car has already had a number of paint nicks and chips in the front bumper. Same with my wife's 2015 M3 and many users also report this soft paint on bimmerpost.com. Not a defect from the factory per se; but poor paint durability in general.
Has only happened once on a very cold morning; very early. Car was taken from garage and driven about 1 hour away. Upon arrival at about 7am the headlights had condensation in them. I was parked next to 5 or 6 M3s/M4s of this same generation and mine was the only one with condensation. I have not taken it to the dealer for this because I have not encountered the problem again but I have also not replicated the conditions. I have pictures from the original incident.
Brake dust is pretty high with this car but it is also a performance braking system so not completely surprised.
Calling from phonebook the car most often misinterprets the name. Adding navigation directions via voice are most often misinterpreted. Same in my wife's 2015 M3 . Have not tried verbal audio or HVAC commands yet. Sometimes you can get it to recognize the voice commands by speaking very; very slowly and deliberately but that is not a guarantee.
There is an intermittant clicking/creaking sound coming from the trim panel that is immediately below the HVAC controls. Pressing on the panel firmly will eliminate the noise for a bit but it comes back. The same panel makes noise in my wife's 2015 M3 .
: When in 2nd or 3rd gear and accelerating fully; there is a grinding noise coming from the transmission tunnel. Sounds like a muted gear grind BUT I have discovered that this is supposedly due to the carbon fiber driveshaft vibrating and contacting the emergency brake cable bracket. I have no taken the car in for this year because the current 'fix' is bending the brake cable bracket out of the way. My wife's 2015 M3  does not exhibit this which leads me to believe that my driveshaft may be out of balance. There are other owners reporting this problem on bimmerpost.com




Rocks from road hitting underside of vehicle is more audible than in my previous vehicles.
Trunk has to be slam to hing to hold
It doesn't fully recognize city's or street names; especially unique street names
It doesn't recognize device and it's hard to hear people at times

only when I am on rough pavement

Sounds like the disk brake heat shield rubbing on something. Have appointment for dealer to check it out in 2 days.
This is not a problem; ccb are supposed to make unusual noise under normal driving.
When you reach for a cup I often hit the radio button and turn it off.

It sounds as though styrofoam is rubbing together - once the car is warm  it goes away.
Difficult to adjust and headrest is to tall for my head
Black molding around top loose and out of place
Swirl marks; blemishes noted on roof and truck portion of car
Oregon highways suffer from stud tires tearing up the asphalt.  This car seems to magnify the tire noise on the road.  Better interior insulation could help reduce the ambient noise.  Have not presented the problem to the dealership yet as the car has not been back for service and the problem is just annoying not catastrophic.
: The satellite radio Sirius XM has intermittent reception in many places up here in Oregon on highways where there does not appear to be a logical cause
Needed replacement
Having difficulty in consistently using this feature. Seems to be too many steps to activate. May get better with use. Only have 600 miles on car.
Again; To many steps to activate.Seems complex. May get better with time.
To much technology. Takes to long to scroll through menu and understand.
SiriusXM reception in Manhattan is terrible.  I have called SiriusXM and they said they are aware of the problem; but it still is not resolved.  The odd thing is that I had very little problems with the SiriusXM reception in my previous BMW 318; so I don't understand why the new car has an issue with reception.
placing hand on trunk to open does not work
: weird smell from engine and cannot open trunk with hand; only the key fob.
: weird engine smell: weird smell from engine and cannot open trunk with hand; only the key fob.
: The control is in a very bad place it constantly gets hit and the screen changes and I have difficulty getting the correct settings back
I do not know how to use
I have been unable to set; do not understand; I find the BMW book very vague
There is no center console storage
Cup holder is set too far forward
Color is difficult to maintain; I assumed they would have been protected for easy cleaning.

Radio sound comes in stronger then weaker.  Location does not seem to be the determining factor.
Must intend to use I-Pod before starting car as it is impossible to connect safely while driving.
Headrest does not sit at a comfortable position for my use & I have been unable to adjust to a better fit.

voice commands don't work;  it will not let me enter the correct city : nothing other than the navigation system
Gas sensor apparently broken when car was filled up with fuel at the dealership.
Every time I try to close my trunk; never at once close it.This is a new car; I don't want to press hard. But you have to; otherwise you won't close it.
Yesterday When I got off work on my way home; I opened the back seat window; that noises made me headache and earache.This is my first time open it.But front seat doesn't have that problem.
Every time I start the car; there is a big noise. After few mins. It will become gentle.
The navigation system requires the street #; street name; and state... in that order.  If a command is misunderstood; one has to start over.  It is easier to enter the info manually. It is most likely that I have not spent enough time to learn the voice commands. The navigation system is not that intuitive.
I use spotify to listen to my music and lately it hasn't been playing in the phone. And the art doesn't match the song
On steering column behind steering wheel in an inconspicuous spot. Other controls in front so even more difficult to find.
Having the door unlock and lock button below the hazard button in the middle of dash console is an unusual place to look for it.  why not on the door????

In the convertible model; the feature where sliding the foot under the car opens the trunk is not available.  You have to squeeze too hard under the trunk lid to get it to open.
The collision avoidance/alert system does not work at all.  It does not what it is supposed to do based on the description and video clips on the BMW site.
The phone system is horrible.  It does not work well with iPhone 6 Plus.  When the phone button on the steering wheel is pushed; it brings up the most recent calls made; and not the entire phone book in the head up display.  It does not bring up any information on the navigation screen at all as it did in the 2012 3 series. : Calls are dropped.  The voice command is weak and often brings up commands that do not even make sense.  You say; 'Call home;' and it sets the temperature to 70 degrees!  Voice command has always been pretty useless in BMWs.  I hear they are going to have Apple Play.  May be then Siri can take over.
Texts were not coming in After working with a sales agent; he fixed that; but you cannot reply to them; although there is an option for that.  The entire navigation system is a hot mess.  The map is minimal and unclear.  You can't get a list of turns; only turn by turn.  Entering an address is a nightmare; and saving it to a contact is haphazard and requires many steps. : Calls are dropped.

Voice command has always been pretty useless in BMWs.  I hear they are going to have Apple Play.  May be then Siri can take over.
The noise is excessive at higher speeds.
When it rains; the interior windshield surface fogs up.
I have had this rattling sound from the right passenger corner.  I have taken the car in twice.  No improvement.  As a matter of fact; I have a THIRD appointment today at 3 at Bob Smith BMW for the same problem. : There is a noise from the wind breaker area in the back seat.
It revs at over 1200 rpm at start.
The car has an Ecopro mode.  In that mode; the A/C is pretty much useless.
I brought it back to the dealer and they had to get a new part from Germany and they fixed it.  It took two days to fix after waiting a week for the part.

Hard to shut off turn signals if you dont turn to full cancel.
Trunk light is in bad location. Blinding if you are on the left side looking into the trunk.

Always selects different state than requested with voice input of address.

The console storage is too shallow to be of much use.

It's just too small and does not extend for coverage on the side window.
It is hard to enter/exit the car without leaving a mark on the sill.
THE DESIGN IS POOR - HARD TO REACH THE LACH; CAN NOT OPEN FROM THE INSIDE; THE CONVERTIBLE SET UP IS POOR COMPARED TO MY PREVIOUS CAR 
system design is poor
It is impossible to enter the car w/o scratching the door liner
Difficult to re-set memory setting
DESIGN OF MEMORY SEAT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE DIFFERENT KEYS.  MUST ACTUALLY PRESS THE SEAT MEMORY BUTTON TO ACTIVATE
I am short so I have the seat adjusted very far forward and up high. The seat belt crosses my neck and shoulder in a very uncomfortable position. When it pulls tight it feels like it is cutting my neck.  I often find myself pulling at the seat belt to get slack so I don't feel like I am being chocked.  When we took a longer road trip I sat with my hand on the belt to loosen it when it would pull too tight. I asked my dealer if there is an adjustment I am missing and they said there is not currently a way to adjust the position of the belt.
Just doesn't recognize my commands. : Voice commands are too sensitive.
Small leak front passenger window.
Crunchy sound right rear of car
Colors of streets are poor and difficult to see; except for freeways. Color adjustment does not change any color.

Stop latch loose screw. Needs tightening
Noise emitting from underside. Sounds like something robbing against a wheel
When car hits a bump ;starts grinding sound which resolves in a few moments
The brakes make a grinding  noise when braking from speeds down to zero.  I have brought it to the dealer twice and I am told it is safe and normal with this type of braking system   I have been assured that as the car ages; it will decrease in volume and feel.
I DO NOT BELIEVE THE FOG LIGHTS ARE BROKEN; THE ONLY TIME THE FOG LIGHTS FLICKER OR GO ON AND OFF IS WHEN YOU HIT A BUMP OR A ROUGHER ROAD..I WILL ADDRESS THIS WITH MY DEALER UPON MY 2500 MILE CHECK UP....

Excessive road noise is coming from the tires. They seem to be a little choppy on the edges.
Difficult to locate; cannot easily see.
Difficult to unlatch. Need several minutes to figure out how to unlatch. ts not easy.
Can't figure out how to retain memory settings.
There was a ding in the driver side door. Rough edge on passenger rear bumper.
It seems like the sunroof assembly is not secured properly to the vehicle.
Black hard plastic on lower door scuffs easily from contact with shoes - while exiting vehicle.
the door doesn't always lock or unlock with this 'keyless' entry feature. I can hold the key in my hand or in my purse; it doesn't work
it gets dirty and scratch
The blades just vibrate and leave the windshield streaky
: When the engine is in start stop mode; when the engine restart upon release of the brake pedal the stereo goes dead for about 3 to 5 seconds before reengaging
Could just be my phone. Moto x. Often had problems connecting
Run-flat tires had two nail punctures. Neither could be repaired. Had to replace tires.
high performance brakes and pads equals to excessive brake dust. I would recommend coating the rims with a material that brake dust will not accumulate or stick.
Too many options for the wiper; it should be more simple than it is. It wipes too fast at the first notch/setting.
Engine oil temp is not present or displayed. I have the technology package and can not find the setting for oil temp display in iDrive.
Poor voice recognition system overall. Please look to google or apple; they have the best technology currently. Volume is difficult to adjust. Only when in the specific program can it be adjusted. Please fix it so the user can change the volume for these features in the volume settings menu. Specifically navigation voice and phone call volumes.
The memory seats do not adjust according to which key is used. Seat memory is not key specific.
It's not really a big issue; but it could be quieter given that it is a luxury vehicle.
Sun visor requires too much force to disengage from lock position






Poor switching from podcasts to audio.  Difficulty loading song lists randomly.

Temperature dial near vents makes little sense.  Does it override the auto temperature functions?

brakes squeak; first noticed after car had sat during cold weather for a couple of weeks
: steering wheel scroll-wheel control for navigating radio stations is poorly designed; sensitive; clumsy; easily overshoots; requires two actions  to complete one function  -- likewise in-dash radio display that 'works' in conjunction with the control requires user to take eyes off the road for an inordinate amount of time
line of sight for the driver seat heating control is blocked; unable to view settings on/off; level without taking eyes off the road for an inordinate amount of time
Built in ask repetitive questions. Does not modify requests to act on new information
no air comes from vent. heating or cooling  Will take to dealer : Driver side AC vent not venting.
Tire was punctured but the dealer agreed to replace at no charge.
Too complicated and time consuming.



Usually cannot find street numbers or even towns.
Cheap material; looks difficult to clean. Should have come with rubber mats
: leather Seats are discolored
I put in an address that I knew was in town but the directions to me out in the country to a field.

Removed headrest to turn it around because it interfered with my helmet when auto crossing.  Stopped at level of first notch and won'go down farther nor will it come back out.
In comparison to other vehicles I own/have owned; there is a lot of brake dust on the wheels.  I wash the vehicle each week and even though I thoroughly clean the wheels each week and drive my commute is primarily highway driving; there is a lot of brake dust that builds up after even just one week.
Upon startup; there is a rattle from the exhaust.  It usually disappears shortly after driving begins.
manufacturing defect
THE LOW BEAM LIGHTS ARE AIMED TOO LOW.  THE HIGH BEAM LIGHTS HAVE A SHADOW THAT SHOWS UP ON THE DRIVERS SIDE.
The low beams are aimed too low. The high beams have a shadow in the center of the light pattern
Not as intuitive as conventional controls. What is the point of over-complicating what should be simple.
The upper middle of the center pad should operate the horn but doesn't. Again more complicated or persnickety than it needs to be.
Knock sensor had to be replaced.
As I said; the door did not close smoothly and seemed to lift up as it closed.  It kind of sprung a bit when opened; as though released from pressure .
The car was just noisy; period.  The road noise was loud; maybe like a sports car; but far more than I liked.
: Just lousy; tinny; flat sound.  Just a poor system; cheap and not in the least enjoyable to listen to .
The door just didn't close smoothly.  Felt like it had to lift up to close.
Just a lot of road noise in normal driving.
For example; I would input the house number and street name. It would only give me the option of selecting one city/ zip code; but it would not be the correct one.




: Repeated TPMS error
iPod connects via Bluetooth; but audio playback does not work correctly. I do not have this problem with my other vehicle. Also when iPod is connected directly via USB; playback will occasionally stop. I will have to disconnect/reconnect to get it working again. Not sure if the issue is a compatibility issue with the iPod version I'm using or interference with other Bluetooth device. Could be a multitude of causes.
Seatbelt was defective and contained a twist in the belt causing it to get stuck during the retraction. Took it to the delearship and they replaced the entire seat belt unit. Problem has been reticfied.
Gap exists between the windshield and dashboard. Enough of a gap to lose a hanging plastic parking permit that fell and slid underneath the dash which could not be retrieved.

I think I have to keep car unlocked to open fuel door which worries me at the gas station.
There was a run in the paint behind left side door at bottom.
Hard too to see at night once inside car with door closed.
Vent wasn't blowing air. Only happened once.
Had to look up how to work in manual but I forgot again.
Wasn't blowing air after I adjusted the mode. It works now. Perhaps it was my operation.
Not intuitive
Not intuitive
: Cup holder inserts missing
: On FM stations; when a live voice comes on air; spoken words randomly reverb. The useable functionality of connecting a device via bluetooth is significantly different than connecting via USB.
hood is difficult to close and was dented
the noise in the car is too loud
some addressed are not listed in the navigation
doesn't retract completely
already has wear and tear on the side of the seat
very poor material choices; adhesive pad on the back of the matt are already coming off
Daytime running light burned out.  BMW repaired problem by replacing the entire headlight assembly.
: Hood did not lay flat after opening; however it was easily fixed when I returned to the dealership

Request repeated; lack of voice commands.
The belt swings back too far when reaching to buckle seat belt. : I haven't had any difficulties; as I assume this helps in someway for the seat belt not to get tangled when entering the back seat.
I wish the stereo system controls was on the steering wheel. It's standard on so many vehicles.
Comes up wrong when finding 'points of interest' ie: only lists certain 'home depots' but not all in area.
When I picked up the vehicle at the Performance Center in SC; I noted that the hood on the driver side has a dent 
Rear brakes make a loud squeal when braking - especially in reverse
I hear a clank/ tap noise front the front driver side a-pillar area especially when going over bumps.
When I reached 5k miles after 3 months of ownership; the engine oil at minimum level light illuminated.
The issue is that the engine will start randomly before I want it to.

The stock brake pads are just very dusty.  In comparison I had a 2013 Mercedes-Benz C350 that I also thought had a lot of brake dust and this M235i has MORE than that.  It cakes on the wheels and is difficult to remove and I wash my car 2 a month.
Warning light came on.  Stopped and restarted engine.  Indication was gone.  No further warnings.
Just seems like a lot... did not have this much with my previous car
Drove out of the delaership and within a mile the TPM system alarm came on and said it couldn't monitor the tire pressure. Go back to the dealer.
Alarm came on as i drove home from delivery
Camera only works if park assist is turned on. But when it is turned on in my garage; the park assist alert in the front of the car turns on very loudly. Annoying
Battery compartment cover in trunk is only held down by weight. Makes a clunking noise when going over bumps
This problem could be caused by car wash wax. Only when pressing lightly coming to a stop do they produce a high pitch steady squeak. It happens on occasion; not all the time. I will address this problem at the first maintenance service.
I think I have the heated steering wheel feature but cannot locate it.
Difficult to enter destination address into system. Often route is inaccurate. Not user friendly.
: Cannot understand the interior control system to heat the interior of car.
Heating controls not intuitive. Cannot get air hot when needed.

The information is difficult to understand.  The names of the streets are not mentioned. : The directions are not accurate.
Importing information is time consuming. Touch screen would be ideal and easier to manage. Turning that wheel is annoying.
It's all in the design. There is a tray for a cell phone that is annoying. There is no storage space.
The visor is too short and does not provide sufficient coverage. It does not work very well. Moving it to the side does not provide any protection.
: Constant low tire pressure; on the same left rear tire.
Rattling/wind noise from drivers door. Took to dealer and they replaced parts and seal around door
Navigation took me 20 miles out of the way for the address entered.
Unfortunately we find that using our cell phones are still faster and easier than the navigation system. Particularly when entering an address; one has to go through many steps of button pushing and dialing to get a correct entry. As per the zooming/panning function; we were out in the middle of the countryside and were trying to find an alternate route while stuck in the worst possible traffic. So since we had the navigation on; I thought it would be easy to simply zoom and pan using the dial and buttons to see if there was some quick way around the incident. However this was much more complicated than it should have been and involved a couple of menu options that I thought unnecessary.
It takes effort to close; nothing wrong mechanically. Just more difficult to close than a lighter trunk door in a sedan.
KEY FAB NEEDS TO BE PRESSED SEVERAL TIMES TO OPEN TRUCK LATCH
UNAWARE NEEDING TO USE KEY FAB TO OPEN CAP FOR FUEL WHICH ALSO UNLOCKS DOORS IN VEHICLE SAME TIME. DIFFICULT CONFIGURATION
WHEN AT STOP LIGHT OR TURNING LEFT SOUNDS LIKE A ROCK IS HITTING MY VEHICLE UNDERNEATH. LOUD BANG.  THERE IS NOTHING HITTING MY VEHICLE FROM UNDERNEATH. SOUND COMING FROM LEFT SIDE OF VEHICLE.
CENTER CONSOLE SHIFTS FORWARD TOO EASILY WHEN REST ARM AND THEN HAVE TO SHIFT BACK TO OPEN.
the default is not set to show street names where you are and where you should turn. Also; POI is sometimes difficult to get to the right category. Voice command doesn't always recognize command
The seat do not fold down; only the back rest of the back seats.  It would be simple to have the backseats that fold flat with the trunk.  In a small SUV; this would be a smart feature
Can't have two peoples elbow resting on it at one time.  My wife and I are small people too; I'm 5'7' 150 lbs and shes 5'2' 120 lbs.

Any time you brush your foot across these areas it leaves a mark.  Additionally; the steering wheel is fading or turning color.
I set the clock when I purchased the vehicle but haven't been able to change the time since daylight savings began a few weeks ago.  Probably operator error!


From moderate speeds on up there is excessive wind noise heard from both front windows towards the front of the windows/doors where the door meets the front of the car.
As stated above.  Controls are behind the turn signal control and too l I w down. Put fibrous on the stearing wheel please.
Dealer salesman had difficult time opening the hood. After delivery had to take back due to poor hood alignment
Not often but twice now I have entered an address and the navigation system cant find the location; so I have to enter the address on my phone to get directions.



This vehicle should have an automatic rear hatch opening as a standard feature.
Tire pressure low light came on after two months of driving the vehicle. Air pressure was checked on all tires and there didn't seem to be a problem.  If you have an indicator; it should be specific to a tire; not just a general tire low that can be attributable to all tires. In our case; all tires were topped off and the light went out.
Driver's side exterior side mirror does not adjust 'up' high enough; passenger side works adequately.

I am sure the scuffs will wipe clean
This class of vehicle should really include a powered liftgate like other vehicles in its market segment. This feature is not even available as an option; or else we would have specified it .
Small door ding in rear passenger door.  It was quickly corrected by the dealer's paintless dent repair wizard.
I suspect the wind noise is coming from the roof rails as it seems to originate from the top of the A-pillars near the top of the windshield; but it could just as easily just be from the windshield molding; mirrors; or even the wipers.
: Steering wheel is too sensitive for highway driving-- I feel as if I touched the wheel I may go off into another lane
can't unlock rear doors without a key or going into the car & pushing the button in the middle of the dashboard. very inconvenient.
can't tap it lightly for a beep

: seat can't get high enough for me to see over the left side mirror so I have a blind spot
I'm petite and can't find a good height
can't put sunglasses in
can't snap it back closed easily with one hand while driving
beige floor mats show dirt too easily need to have a choice of a darker shade or ability to replace it. Also too much velco for keeping it in place so it's hard to remove.






Does not open easily and has to be closed several times to ensure tat it's locked.
Wind noise when I drive with the driver window open.  Very annoying.
I repeatedly have to turn my phone off then on again to get a connection.
Two days after delivery I noticed a crack in the windshield at te upper left side.  It was conveniently covered with a sticker.  I peeled of the sticker; saw the crack; and went back to the dealer.  Was told by the service manager that I must have caused the window to crack by exerting too much pressure with my thumb when removing the sticker!  They refused to do anything and I ad to go through my insurance company.  I will never go back to ths dealer.
: Hesitation upon acceleration.  I can feel the gears change when braking.  Not smooth at all.
: Hesitation upon acceleration.  I can feel the gears change when braking.  Not smooth at all.







Dealership needed to completely reprogram software in the vehicle because of a valve malfunction.


That was the hardest feature to get to work for me. Not user friendly.
The 'bolt on' cup holder takes up space from passenger side. The 2 cup holders should be in the console like other cars. On top of that when I went to pull out the cup holder and put it back in to see if I could get used to pulling in and out; I found a razor blade down under the flap. I cut my finger.
There is not extend or retract on mine. The visor doesn't go down far enough for a 5'5' female.  When driving east during sun rise or west during sunset I am blinded. I had to buy a funky plastic visor extension. Not pretty in my pretty BMW X1.



It interferes with access and is pretty flimsy.  We have removed it; but may put it back for traveling with luggage.  We have a 2002 328XI  BMW station wagon that has a far superior cover.
This may have been a combination of the steering and the tires as it seems to have gone away now that the tires have worn in a little. But when first purchased the car felt like you were driving a skateboard very loose on the highway especially if there was any kind of wind or turbulence like a truck nearby.
Everything opens great but when you go to close the shade closes but the sunroof stays open and then you have to open the shade and fool around with the sunroof button until the sunroof closes and then finally it closes and you can close the shade. Have yet to figure out how to do it correctly.
I'm not even sure how you turn the interior lights on without opening the door. Never tried it.
Most of the time that I go to use it I accidentally hit my high beams instead of the cruise control because of the location of the cruise control. Took me over two months and about 3;000 miles to figure out even how to work the cruise control. Too complicated.
: The seats are not as comfortable as other luxury cars especially if you make daily long commutes and the controls for placing the car in cruise control are difficult to access. Not really a car to have if you make long commutes better for short commutes shuttling children or picking up groceries; etc.
The rear compartment does not maintain the temperature.
the manual height adjustment is difficult to operate in that it is difficult to move up and down without jumping up and down on the seat. I can hold onto the roof or outside of the car and push down but its otherwise hard to move the seat lower; I weigh about 130lbs for reference.
The cup holder on the passenger side  is in a poor location for my husband; who is 6'3'. We typically have to remove the cup holder when he is in the front seat due to the obstruction
lock feature is to sensitive
the voice commands are delayed and annoying. Using the phone directly is faster and easier.
says i can read messages but no one can tell me how to do it.
it is antiquated compared to google maps.  You should just use google to handle your maps and nav. Traffic is way better I end up using my phone to navigate traffic.
normally you can open your trunk or lock other doors on the side of the drivers. there is only a lock button in the middle of the dash board.

It's not able to recognize my voice many times.

The trunk light comes on often although i've closed the trunk.
I noticed that it brings back other than stated words or puts together more than one word to create a new one. I must clarify that I have a foreign accent that may contribute to the issue... We are adapting to the system's style and may find it better as we communicate with it in different ways
Complicated self locking latch inside fuel cover flap; very frustrating. Operator can easily find it impossible to close flush with body of the car.
Scratch very noticeable white scrape is a small crescent shape scratch on front right bumper. Especially disappointing as the dealer covered it with a square patch of black electrical tape. Thus it was noticed for a while. Reported to dealer via phone voice message and e-mail but received no reply.
Rails are flush with roof. Therefore not easily adaptable to add on hardware for transport of bikes; skis; cargo boxes; kayaks; etc.
Fortunately I was aware of this concern from reading product reviews on the internet.



BMW tech-savvy staff have twice tried to program this function. It is still not operational. Also cannot access the on-board BMW Genius system with data and FAQ function that are supposed to be provided.

Detachable second cup holder near front passsenger seat obstructs access to console and to seatbelt connecter. Also bumps passenger leg. Hard to detach.

The back wipers are hard to turn on and off.



It is very low so in the daytime the glare of the sun whether bright or not makes it impossible to read. You have to bend ypur head down to see the station playing at the time.
Both holders can basically hold only bottled soft drink size. Anything else is too large. Very disappointed.
Difficult to pull from the insertion located close to the passengers leg.
Sometimes I have to turn off/on the bluetooth on my phone; so it can connect to the car's built-in bluetooth. When I connect the phone to the USB to charge the phone; it automatically disconnects itself from bluetooth; and when I try to connect it again; once the phone is charged; it take multiple attempts; before it successfully pairs to the the car's built-in bluetooth.
Cup holder in poor location.

If the car is locked because I am outside; I cannot close the fuel door until I unlock the car.

I still can't figure out how to turn on my rear wipers without it spraying out water first.  I can't figure out how to control the front one either.


Notice the immediately brakes don't seem to have enough stopping power! Scary.
NO OPTION FOR SATELLITE RADIO.  RIDICULOUS!  Called dealer twice on this.
Location is challenging on usb port.  Only one port site.
Blue tooth shouldn't have problems in 2015
Loud; no rear seat vent.  I know it is no frills; but seems cheap.
Rear cargo door is difficult to close.  If not slammed 'VERY HARD' shut; it doesn't close properly. Cargo door light goes on; need to pull over. PAIN!
doesn't clean up easily.  Dirty haze.
Feel like shift doesn't always catch/engage.  Told a friend was afraid of going through my garage when pulling in to driveway.  Doesn't always engage.
Doesn't engage properly.  Also starts up abruptly when at a complete stop with eco control on. Rough!
Something isn't right with shift. Engaging in park is difficult or skips.
Hard to open back tail gate door
Hazard switch located next glove box . When getting something out of the glove box I accident turn on the hazard switch. I exited the car and did not realize the hazard lights were on. There were on for almost 8 hours
Had difficulty putting down the back seat
Have a child car seat and the back seat belt does not fit the space allowed
Light color shows marks very easy and not sure what to use to clean the marks. Light carpet shows dirt very fast
Not understanding how to adjust temp controls
What can I say...the car is a bit noisy.  In part the wind noise may be associated with the rattles in the window .  But generally the wind noise is louder than I would have expected from a BMW.
The car could use a bit more sound insulation.  I don't think there's anything wrong with the car; just not enough sound insulation.
I have taken the car in to BMW Service.  They say they can't reproduce the rattles.  But I pick up the car and barely drive away from the dealership and there it is....the persistant rattle.  I can only think the service guys are deaf; or just not paying attention.   Its really a bad experience; the car sounds like a junker; and I am dismayed I've paid so much for a car assembled with this kind of poor quality.  BMW HAS NOT MET MY EXPECTATION....all because of a rattle.

The space is only designed to store the removable cup holder and a non-I Phone phone. This renders it virtually useless for storing anything else.
Cup holders are awkwardly placed and do not hold large cups. Also; the first time I used the console holder it pierced the styrofoam cup and the contents leaked into some mysterious cavern beneath the console.
The first time we drove the car; the carpets showed black footprints.
I think I sometimes speak to fast for the system to clearly understand my words for streets and cities. So I am going to try speaking more slowly and see if I can fix it myself before getting the dealer involved.

There was a small puncture in the tire; I'm not sure what caused it.  My problem with the tire is that it cannot be repaired.  It has to be replaced anytime there is any type of puncture whatsoever.  I'm not a fan of the run flat tire.
i am very short and hatch is a little harder to close because I have to stand on my tiptoes to close it.  occasionally i get the trunk still open warning but it is closed.  i had a push button autoclose feature on my last car adn should be in this one.
the keyless touch entry to unlock the doors is not on the rear doors.  If you unlock the driver door; it will only unock the driver door so you have to get into the car to hit the unlock button or use your key to unlock the other doors.  Neither is convenient when you have passengers or when you want to put your briefcase or something in the back.  I looked for a programmable option but have notyet found it.
the drivers side exterior side mirror is really small and doesn't move far enough inward for really short people like me to be able to use them unless I am sitting a certain way.  Much bigger blind spot.
Difficult to understand; still don't know how to use the heater
can't understand how the heater works
: Auto rear hatch feature  not operative.  Rear hatch frequently does not close completely with normal force generating a warning message and requiring operator to exit vehicle and re-close.

Have latest iPhone 6 with latest OS. Plugging phone in to USB cable (to control music through wheel controls 'deletes' Bluetooth connectivity when iPhone is unplugged - having to pair iPhone anew each time is a serious problem. Long trips in car are best done with USB cable and short trips are best with Bluetooth. Same phone same driver. Why?
TRUCK WOULD NOT OPEN EASILY AND CAUTION LIGHT WOULD SAY TRUNK WAS OPEN WHEN FIRST STARTING THE CAR

: ALARM WOULD GO OFF WHILE DRIVING. WINDOWS AND ROOF OPEN WHILE IN GARAGE
: ALARM WOULD GO OFF WHILE DRIVING. WINDOWS AND ROOF OPEN WHILE IN GARAGE

Gets names and addresses incorrect.  Prefer to use manual input.  Saves time and frusration
Goodyear Eagles were a surprise on a German built BMW. In my opinion they have a very rigid sidewall which causes a harsh ride over bumps. And this may be exacerbated by the recommended 38 PSI in the rear tires; vs. 32 front. They are run-flats.
The indicator light is not visible from the normal driving position. A minor issue not worth complaining about.
phone does not connect contact information every time it must try at least 6 or more times before stopping
Anytime the car comes in contact with water ; water gathers at the sides of the door at the bottom.
Car will not recognize phone as storage device. Directory of music files will not appear on my nav/entertainment screen. I rented a ford pickup truck; and it was able to do it. : Car will not recognize phone as storage device. Directory of music files will not appear on my nav/entertainment screen. I rented a ford pickup truck; and it was able to do it.It doesn't have the cap[ability.
: Heated steering wheel does not reach a warm-enough temperature.
does not operate smoothly; requires slamming to close
i can't figure out if i do or do not have auto light controls. the dealer told me i do but i can't figure out when they are in automatic.  when i drive through a dark tunnel i don't see the headlights turn only the daytime running lights seem to be on
it seems that you cannot adjust the height while actually sitting in the seat. it won't move
the system seems slow to respond in the non-AC mode.  ventilation with outside air requires very high fan speed.
the storage compartments on the doors are very poorly designed.  you cannot fit a road map in any of the four compartments.  at best you can fit 2 CD's. you can't fit even a pair of gloves.
shifting from first to reverse and vice versa is dicey. often it will shift back into reverse rather than into first.  you must be careful not to  jump forward or back when you don't want to.
Noticed that th glass appears to be pushed out from the inside center of the window. Does not seem to be a major issue.
The system can occasionally shut off when I immediately stop and when I try to engage the clutch it does not immediately start.
I pointed out the minor blemishes and without any complaint or question BMW took care of it and fixed it before I left the building.
Some HD FM stations sound terrible and get cut off completely at times





Hood closes in misaligned position. It's OK when I re-closed it.
Lower door and sill panels scuff easily from shoes when entering and exiting the car.

Phone starts to play local music on the device automatically even when not desired and also after the door is open and car is off. Have to press the car off button a second time even after the door is opened.

Just strange to need to press a button and move the level...when it's not mechanical.
Points of interest; street and city names; and other words are not correctly understood by the voice recognition system when entering locations for navigation.
 Many points of interest that should be present are not found in the system.  Cannot send locations from cell phone maps or stored addresses to vehicle GPS.  I usually end up using Google Maps app on my cell phone for guidance because search is so much easier. Better integration with cell phone via bluetooth  would vastly improve the experience.

: Really terrible speakers and sound; esp due to fact I paid for the HK upgrade Really disappointing
Has trouble receiving Pandora; cuts out ;won't re-pair
The iDrive display turns off when thereat is used with the top down in cooler temps
Rubber window moulding gouge
Wind noise on freeway
Too small; doesn't hold large drinks/bottles.
The arm rest  interferes a little bit with hand brake when console is closed. The problem is something I can live with.
The available space is too cramped to be of general utility.  The smart phone cradle does not fit any phone we use; and just gets in the way.  This is a problem we can work with.

Difficult to use;

The seat belt attachment/clip rattles when not in use. Couldn't identify when taken to the dealer; passenger seat belt was in use
the cell phone slot/panel doesn't stay on when console cup holder is in use
expected a quiet running vehicle
Very small dings. Dealer repaired one week later.
iDrive menus are extremely confusing. No visual display of volume; so can go from muted to TOO LOUD with no warning. There is no 'pause' function on any audio playback source; just 'mute' or 'on'. Sometimes music plays when we don't want it. Phone pairing is spotty and confusing to control. Voice controls are so bad we almost never use them.
Having to enter house numbers one digit at a time is ridiculous. I know of no other voice recognition system that requires that. When it's wrong; it's really really wrong.
Office' functions  are extremely hard to set up; and don't always work; for no obvious reason. Some things work with my wife's phone; but not with my identical iPhone 5S.
Voice control of nav system is so bad we've given up using it. Addresses must be entered in EXACTLY the format it wants; or the results are laughably wrong.
It took a while before we were sure the seat memory function was working properly. Some of this may be due to settings that are not all that easy to find; in menus operated from iDrive. We still don't understand the difference between the memory that goes with the keyfobs; and the memory buttons on the left side of the driver's seat.
Phone adapter takes up most of the space; even if the snap-in adapter is not installed.
There is a weird delay when starting up from a complete stop. Doesn't happen in sport mode; and can to some extent be ameliorated by manually clicking to 1st gear with steering wheel paddles when starting from a standing stop.
The latch was working
It almost feels like I need to add pressure to the peddle in order to come to a full stop.
Poor location; I have not been able to get it to work
Names; person or street


the plastic caps covering the towing pulls were loose & continuly became disengaged
There is a phone attachment in the console that is awkward & in the way. There isn't any change holders; coins get stuck in the bottom
usb port specifcally used for loading media files into the onboard system is very awkwardly located in the glovebox. It's difficult to find and difficult to insert a USB memory stick to load media files. In my case; its also was broken and does not work.
for the X1; the front passenger cupholder seems very much like and afterthough/add-on. When installed it is very close to the passengers legs. If it is unintalled  there is no convenient place to store it. Not the end of the world; but seems like a less than excellent design in an otherwise well designed car.
at a stop light; you have to put more pressure on the break so it doesn't roll...it's funny; I'm getting used to it; and am a BMW; the ultimate driving machine loyalist...so not complaining; just have to make sure the car doesn't roll
very hard to grab
the 'M' class has a muffler that makes a lot of excessive rev noise.  My 535 wagon with the same engine is so quiet !  This car sounds like a race buggy.  I wanted the bigger engine for pickup but didn't expect the noise from BMW
passenger seat belt goes off if I place my purse in the seat.  I need to keep it in place.
BMW seems to think that everyone lives in Germany.  The black interior needs cooling.  The air is so loud that you cannot talk over it.  It needs to be full blast to get any result and then heats up again quickly when turned down.
they could do a better job with this
Every time I open the sunroof the fabric made door beneath the glass window smells weird. It happened the same with the X3 I used to have before.
Wind noise is too high for a $50;000 car.
Road noise is too high for a $50;000 car.
Brakes 'moan' when backing out of garage and driveway after car sits overnight.
Rear cargo cover leaves a 2-inch gap between the seat back and the cargo cover; allowing visual access to trunk contents.
Comes equipped with cell phone adapter which can't be removed and is in the way when trying to use the center console for storage.
Center console cup holder is either obscured by the console storage compartment; or puts cup in the way of right elbow when console/arm rest is retracted and cup holder in use.

Seat Belt on driver side not vertically adjustable. Hits me at neck level. : Seat belt hits at my neck and is not adjustable vertically.
Car moves in drive even if handbrake is on
Took car for service and it was fixed. : Tire pressure monitoring system failure. Also oil level measuring system does not work.
: Tire pressure monitoring system failure. Also oil level measuring system does not work.
: Oil level measuring does not work.
Seat material not breathable.
The tire pressure sensor does not tell me what PSI is in each tire but it says it is low. Older vehicles and less expensive vehicle do this; not sure why mine does not
It just doesn't seem to get all stations very clear in the city or anywhere in town. sometimes it is better than others.
Frequently I have to re-configure my mobile device to play Blue tooth audio. Sometimes it shows connected and playing but no sound
It seems like the mold or musty smell only happens after it rains and car has been outside for several hours like over night or during a long work day.
very difficult to enter a destination. Also I have to sit in the car to enter a new destination. I have found the easiest way is to enter the destination in my smartphone phone  book. The blue tooth interface picks it up and I can then select it easily.
: The mat in the cargo area is way too slippery. Objects slide all over the place unless tied down in some manner. I did not have this problem with my 08 Toyota RAV 4.

: Was stopped at traffic light and all the windows and sun roof all opened at the same time.

Horrible phone jack that takes up too much space in the console.  Also; have to store the cup holder inside the console; very inconvenient
bad location over all for the front cup holder; if I have a passenger their leg will brush up agaginst it. Poorly designed







Several scratches noticed on the roof.

Occasionally gets folded up and stuck in the locking mechanism.
In my 2012 328i; during the day the speedometer and tachometer were back-lit with a white light during the day.  That light changed to amber at night.  In the 2 series; these same gauges are not back-lit during the day.  Wearing sunglasses or driving in shade; it can at times; be difficult to see.  Just a very strange thing to leave out of a $50;000 car.
: BMWs have central air vents that feature a hot/cold knob that can be adjusted independently of the driver and passenger vents.  In all the BMWs I've driven ; the central vents responded to the temperatures set via the climate controls and I rarely; if ever; had to touch that hot/cold knob.  In the 2 series; it appears that the central vents are slow to respond to temperature settings.  Set the temperature to 74 on a 50 degree day and the central vents blow cool air unless a) you set the temperature to 78 or b) you turn the hot/cold knob towards hot.  Similar behavior with the A/C.  Dealer claims that the climate control system is behaving properly; but it's unlike anything I've experienced with a BMW before.

If my bluetooth is on and I attempt to use Google Maps; my BMW 2 series will make a phone call to my own phone number and stay on the line for 15-45 seconds until it will allow me to hang up. It will hang up and music will continue to play for roughly 20 seconds until the car makes another phone call to my own number again. it will do this over and over again. Because of this; I am not able to have bluetooth on in my car if I am using Google Maps App. BMW should really come standard with navigations in 2015 anyway. : If my phone is connected to bluetooth and I am using 'GoogleMaps'; my phone will make a phone call to itself and cut off any music that is playing. It will make a phone call to my own phone number and wait on the line for 15-30 seconds until it allows me to hang up. It will do this over and over again. Because of this I have to make sure my bluetooth is off if I am using Google Maps
Inside trunk release button is located in an inconvenient location. It requires driver to lean forward and down in an uncomfortable position. Inside trunk release button should be relocated to a more convenient location in the cabin; which doesn't require an awkward driver position to operate.
Halogen headlights are dated technology and do not provide adequate lighting at night. HID Xexon or LED headlights should be standard equipment on a premium brand like BMW.
These front seats are uncomfortable and certainly not consistent with a premium quality brand like BMW. The seat cushion bottom is too short lacking both adequate thigh and lateral support. The seat back cushion lacks lumbar support of any type. The M235i comes standard with sport seats whereas the 228i does not. Sport seats should be standard equipment on this vehicle. I'd gladly pay an additional $1K for sport seats; which provide adequate support.
AUTO WIPERS ARE EITHER TOO FAST OR TOO SLOW; USUALLY TOO SLOW; SO YOU SWITCH TO LOW WHICH IS TOO FAST; CAN BE VERY ANNOYING; AND AUTO LIGHT INDICATOR IS HIDDEN BY STEERING WHEEL
The steering column blocks the trip computer area.  Not a very good design.
I wouldn't say that the radio has POOR reception.  But it does have an occasional problem.  Usually there are approximately 2 or 3 'blips' during a song.  The blip lasts for approximately a half second; and sounds similar to a record skipping.  When the blip is over; the song comes back on; albeit about a half second later In the song.  I attribute this to the HD reception momentarily being 'dropped'.
Clock is fast by a few minutes and resetting it does not help.
The 'Show Traffic' feature does not work. It does not connect to the internet to get traffic info.
Top part of rear defroster doesn't work. : The top of the rear window defroster does not work.
Give it an address or name of a place and at times comes up with something totally un related. Can be while sitting in the car stopped.
My BMW bluetooth does not play musics on my phone. All the other functions are working fine calls;and messaging. However; it does not play song in library nor recognize Youtube function.
I never had hard time adjusting seats before using different cars; but somehow my back always hurts after driving for about 30 minutes.
I never had hard time adjusting seats before using different cars; but somehow my back always hurts after driving for about 30 minutes.
Not enough room between cup-holder and space atop of cup-holder. only coins can fit in that area.

My navigation was never set up. Was told by the dealer they would send a code for me to place to activate the system. Never happened. Went in for the month f/u; told them the issue -still not working -never worked. Still have not received code or any number to activate the system.
Sometimes handle won't go into gear: i.e reversing and then stop and then hit drive -didn't go into drive. Took 3-4 minutes before we could get it into drive.

Passive restraint system malfunction


Not really a problem per se but sometimes the seatbelt rubs against the edge of the seat causing an irritating noise because I'm not tall enough for my shoulder to keep the seatbelt from rubbing against the seat.
: Whenever I change the radio station; it skips one time a few seconds later.
I would expect better stopping power in a sports car. The brakes are OK but could be better
right rear tire well panel protrudes just a bit. not the same on the other side of the vehicle.
there is a tan colored streak on the passenger side door that cannot be removed.
didn't like the factory bulbs; replace with brighter bulbs



entering new address is in wrong order- have to pick the house #; then street; then city; if you put the wrong street type  it puts you in the wrong city; if the street is long it presents a list of segments divided by zip code- who the heck know the zip code? search for a point of interest is very non-intuitive- impossible to use while driving.
the retraction tension is weak- belt doesn't retract without assistance
: OFTEN WILL NOT PLAY IPHONE.

does not seem to understand the way I speak??


: Missing under dash 12v power outlet
: Upper region of rear window defroster not working
Needed software update
Dent in hood. Has been fixed at no charge


Phone does not play audio from phone such as youtube through the bluetooth device.
The seat belt gets caught when trying to pull it out to put on. It seems to twist and then will not retract.

As stated earlier; the mechanism used the lift the trunk when either the button on the fob or when the release on the trunk is pulled; does not do sufficient job of raising the trunk.
There is condensation.
It is in a poor location.  There should be one in the center console.
The headrest on the 2 Series is manual unlike the power operated feature in the other BMWs I have owned.  It is extremely difficult for me to reach my hands behind my head to adjust manually.
The storage areas on the door frames are made of cheap plastic; and because of their cheap design; anything objects that are placed inside are still very visible.
When the button is popped for the trunk to open; it only unlocks; it does not open entirely like the other BMW models.  It is probably the result of the cheap mechanism that was used to raise the trunk lid on this model; as compared to the one used on other BMW models.
The center console is made of extremely cheap materials.  It is no wonder why the console makes noise.
The materials are cheaply made and therefore don't always align properly.
The center console is made of cheap materials; small and doesn't allow for storage of hardly any kind.  There is no power source housed within the center console like there is in the other BMWs for charging devices such as cell phones.
The cheap plastic that houses the storage area on the door frame scuffs very easily.
14.5 in. from right    4.5 in. up 6 small chips filled with paint but not buffed smooth.
soft

does not fit my wife aka 5 feet tall The seat are very hard; but it's small car.
headrest is to big.  I changed out 2nd row to front row headrest
no room
it's just plastic anything you put in that's padded rattles


AUTOMATIC MODE APPEARS TO WORK ONLY OCCASIONALLY
KEYLESS ENTRY DOES NOT ACTIVATE HORN WITH A DOUBLE-CLICK OF DOOR LOCK. THIS IS VERY USEFUL IN A CROWDED PARKING LOT; OR NOISEY LOCATION WHEN A HORN ACTIVATION COULD A) HELP LOCATE THE CAR AND B) ENSURE IT IS LOCKED.
SIZE OF SPEEDOMETER/TACHOMETER IS TOO LARGE AND DIGITAL DISPLAY IS TOO LOW IN ORDER SEE WHOLE SPEEDOMETER/TACHOMETER DIALS AND DIGITAL DISPLAY AT THE SAME TIME.
APPEARS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH MY SERVICE - AT&T 'PAY AS YOU GO'
DIFFICULT TO FIND AND PUSH BUTTONS SINCE THEY ARE FLUSH TO ONE ANOTHER.  ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT WITH DRIVING GLOVES ON.
NO CONVENIENT SPACE FOR AUDIO CD STORAGE
Instructions are not clear. The automatic setting has wipers go to slowly. Automatic setting should have the ability to be always on. When the washer button is pushed the wipers don't wipe. What possible situation would you want washer fluid but no wipers?
Turn signal doesn't always stay on or stays on too long. Very little distinction between turns and lane changes
Not sure what controls actually do
Controls are hard to distinguish from Mirror retraction button
Gauge is blocked by steering wheel : Steering wheel blocks the view of the instrument cluster
System is way to complex to try and change stations or media. It was not at all clear at time of purchase which functions  were included in which package : System is too complicated


Belt is stuck halfway retracted and sometimes gets caught in door
All materials scuff easily and have not been able to get salt and sand out of carpet
The drivers information readout has been showing average fuel consumption of 16.1 MPG and I drive the car almost exclusively in economode. I understood that the car was rated for 25MPG for city driving
NO OPTION TO DO SINGLE WIPE.
TOO SENSITIVE.
WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN WHEN BUTTON ON KEYS INADVERTENTLY PRESSED IN POCKET.
BAD LOCATION; EASY TO HIT BY MISTAKE.



fuel consumption isn't excessive exactly; it just doesn't match the specs.
doesn't work properly - not controlled well from screen
Sometimes doesn't reconnect properly
Uncomfortable for long legged drivers
Exterior roof / door edge chrome moulding is slightly misaligned such that the 'line' from from to rear is slightly broken visually.
: There is no water temperature gauge.  Even an icon on the display would be sufficient.  Steering wheel heater ON/OFF indicator is on the button; but that is hard to look at during driving conditions.  A small icon on the display is necessary to indicate whether it is ON or OFF.
When AC is engaged; it makes some noise for the first few minutes.  Then it goes away.
Just not big enough; and you have to sort of twist to open it. The side storage  needs to have a pulldown closure like the BMW before this one had. Stuff falls out since it's open; and the storage space is weird.
Things fall out; the space seems awkward as constructed.
They seem small. Also; because there is not enough easily accessible and good storage for things I need to have available quickly  the cupholders are used for that.
Doesn't understand commands. Navigation particularly problematic. It asks for street address; city; and state. Frequently it will misunderstand the city or state names
I hit two potholes within a month. Both tires had to be replaced with the rims. In addition there was Significant suspension damage both times. This series BMW should not be sold in any area that experiences significant winter weather.
Swirls in the clear coat.   Dealership admitted responsibility; however; refused to be either timely or Cooperative.

Bass level is very weak.   Woofers are under the seats and that's not an option above.
: BMW online always 'trying' to connect.   My home screen is split with weather and the weather side is always blank since it cannot connect.
Drops connection.  Doesn't recognize phone when it's seeking pairing.
Asks me to turn on bridges.  doesn't recognize highways and thinks I'm driving through fields.
Never retracts correctly.   Must be fed slowly or it folds over and jams.
Brake squeal in fronts when coming to stop with light pedal pressure.
When parking in covered lot and turning there seems to be some rattle or looseness in front suspension.  Not particularly objectionable; but does not seem normal.
2 flat tires.
It's in the center console enclosure; which is just a pain in the butt; there should be one outside of the box and more easily accessible.
Often my mobile phone won't automatically connect or will take several minutes before eventually connecting after entering vehicle.  Also; and I may be doing it wrong; but when I am using bluetooth but then arrive at my destination; and I attempt to switch from bluetooth to the phone; it does not switch.
When there are two or more people in the vehicle ; the windshield and front windows fog up quickly.  It's a small car so I don't think it's a design flaw; it's just life.
The latches seem to have a great deal of resistance to actuate. Also at times the window does not lower properly to enable a free opening of the door. It catches sometimes.
It's a clunking when you open the latch. It has a great deal of resistance and does not work smoothly.
The latches seem to not work smoothly and it takes a great deal of pressure to activate.
Brake dust is far worse than any other car I own. 
The backup camera screen is too small. Much smaller than the competition. The many color guidlines in the screen are confusing and dominate the screen making it diffucult to see a clear rear image.
I find it not very intuitive and it takes too many moves to do simple operations.
The door requires a lot of effort to pull shut and something rattles inside when it is closed. I also think the window does not lower properly when opening the door causing it to catch on the trim and also clunk.

The mat is not misaligned. The mat is about an inch short to the base of the gas pedal and causes a pseudogap
I knew this was an issue before i purchased the car. greater performance is worth the extra maintenance.
the usb input does not support my new cell phone yet. the location of the aux is inconveniant; and there should be a space for a wire to come out of the center console.

i would like there to be a bit more separation between the pedals.  They are comfortably positioned; but certain shoe soles catch on one pedal on the other at times.
I seem to always have an issue when playing podcasts through my Iphone via bluetooth. It seems to constantly skip intermittently.
The system is not as easy to use as the Garmin unit that I have.
Minor but annoying.
Easy to hit the door with a foot upon exiting.  Leaves a scuff mark.
The real issues is that one has to exactly memorize the menu command.  It does not recognize synonyms or variant approaches to asking for the same thing.

When the blade swipes the window it misses about two inches in the middle of the swipe.
The HD Radio is constant static. The @HD icon on screen is rarely on; it flickers at best. If the siglnal switches to manual on its own or if I switch it; it does not help the signal. It does not matter where I am driving.
Windshield fog bottom  up when I put the A/C on.  After a few minutes after after having the A/C on; the bottom part of the windshield fogs up on the front passenger side. I would put the defroser on which is very loud; but it took a long time to clear up; so often times I open and close the front passenger window.



It will probably be fine once I learn it but the dials just aren't as simple as previous cars I have owned.
Its tiny. There is a top part for an old outdated iphone so cant even use it and it takes up all this space for an already small console space area.
Vision seems distorted
: When the glove box handle is pulled all the way to the front; it blocks the handbrake.
It is too difficult to store an address. I still do not fully understand how to do it.
When the vehicle is near a stop the engine makes a noise and vibrate sometimes. It seems to attempt to do the automatic shutdown during a complete stop; but did it too early.

i wish there was a way to open all four doors from the drivers side.  seems i can only open my door and then have to reach way into the center console to unlock the other doors
it took me a while to figure out where the control to turn on was and also thought it should have a multi level heating value - sometimes I would like a little heat not full blast always when on.
It is hard to understand how to make the radio display the name of the songs/artists.  Was only showing the radio station.
The fact that is two seperate piece to remove and store when not in use is not user friendly
One would think that for the price you pay for this car; there should be an automatic door close function for the hatch/tailagate.


The car advertises 28 city and 32 highway.  We do use premium gasoline and are getting about 20 city and 26 highway
Within two weeks of receiving the vehicle; I noticed paint flaking off the trailing edge of the driver side front bumper. I also noticed what appears to be oxidised polish around the front driver wheel well. Since the the Boston dealership transferred the car from a Connecticut dealership I suspect the car may have had repaired lot damage even though it had been presented to me as a new car. It also had 107 miles when it should have been less then 20 mile and I was told it was flat bed trucked from Connecticut.
The heating / AC controls are just not intuitive; even after reading manual the operation and symbols are not clear. Maybe this is a product of the difference between US and Europe?
Not serious. Will investigate cause as time permits.



The address can not be entered without changing the 'city' and 'state'.  My former vehicle - Acura RDX would accept the address and list possible locations by distance from my current location.  Also; the icons are difficult to read as is the black lettering on the gray field.
: Navigation system destination doesn't transfer properly from my phonebook.

Often when switching to reverse it goes into neutral
turbo lag
Trunk hatch handle requires excessive pressure to activate for open and release








If you hold the rear hatch open button on the key fob for more than a couple of seconds the alarm goes off.  You have to hold it just long enough to open; but not too long.  Often when I press on it for a second as the manual says I should; the hatch doesn't open.  It seems to take somewhere between 1 and 3 seconds so I'm always hoping I can get it to open without the alarm going off.  Very poor design.
The controls are very oddly set up and I'm really not sure they are working properly.  The little wheel that is supposed to change speed of the intermittent wipers doesn't seem to do anything and when I push the stalk up once it should; I believe; turn on the intermittent wipers; but just turns on the regular ones at a slow speed.  When it's pushed up again they are at high speed.  The rain sensor wiper control is at the end of the stalk; but not easy to locate because it is obstructed by the steering wheel.
The light comes on when the temperature is low and causes the tire pressure to change slightly.  This seems too sensitive and causes concern when unnecessary.
Odd design.  I keep flashing the high beams because I think I'm using the cruise control stalk when I'm actually hitting the light control stalk.
There is a small clock display on the radio; but the one on the dashboard; which the driver more safely can look at is blocked out when breaking because of the notice saying that the auto-stop is either engaged or not.
The slot for the key is impossible to see unless I look around the steering wheel.  It can't easily be found by feel.


the door close hard  .

i think it is not bright enough and  lights is must be stander on all BMW lines.


: i notes noise when i put the windows up or down. driver side door dose not sound as smooth as other door when closing. back window wiper is noise when operating.
: i notes noise when i put the windows up or down. driver side door dose not sound as smooth as other door when closing. back window wiper is noise when operating.
it is hard to locate the central lock key. we used to it in the driver door side not in the middle console.
i can not even see the operation light indicator when the steering wheels in straight position. have to turn the wheel to check if it is on or not.
voice recognition on my old Mazda worked much easier than BMW.

I find it difficult to reach into the center of the car when entering in order to unlock the back doors.  Because I have keyless entry; I don't have my key fob in my hand that would make it easier to unlock the back doors.
CAR PULLS TO THE LEFT
TPMS should display tire pressures - my husband's NISSAN does.
Memory card port located in glovebox.  Difficult to find and use.  VERY slow uploading; making this feature useless to me. : iPod port inconvenient.  It should be in center console or glove box; so I can leave the iPod in the vehicle in a hidden location.  I don't like it to flop around while driving.  If located in console or glovebox; eliminates this as a distraction.
too much nesting.  interface should be simpler.
I find it odd I have to hold the button until seat moves to desired location.  It should be one-touch.
wiper stalk fell apart during use
The pressurized gas shocks do not help in popping the hatch open when the release button is pressed; just too heavy as it slams back down.



During any type of conditions and with max temperature set to 84 degrees; it does not feel close to that temperature at all. I have been lucky enough to drive most of the manufactured brands in the U.S. and this BMW X1 is by far has the worst heater performance.
User error as windshield washer fluids comes out by accident as I turn the rear wiper blade on.
The cord that was purchased online from BMW to connect the iphone/ipad is awkward and does not allow for the USB & AUX cord to lay nice.
It's just awkward








DIFFICULT TO USE IF YOU ARE A PERSON OF SHORT STATURE WITH THE SEAT FORWARD.
SART/STOP ENGINE ON.
AS STATED IN MY PRIOR RESPONSE; THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK; SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN PLACED IN THE CAR; IT IS LIFE THREATENING; POSSIBLE REAR END COLLISION. BMW KNEW OF THIS EXISTING CONDITION AND STILL REMAINS TO IGNORE THE PROBLEM; ONLY TO SATISFY EPA GAS STANDARDS; WHILE DEFRAUDING THE PUBLIC.
START/STOP ENGINE ON.
START/STOP ENGINE WORKS ONLY IN THE MOST IDEAL SITUATIONS. IF ONE CONTINUES TO USE THIS FUNCTION IT PLACES EXCESSIVE WEAR ON THE ENGINE AND ENGINE PARTS. THIS WAS NOT STATED TO ME WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR. THE FUNCTION IF IT COULD OPERATE; IS A HAZARD; DUE TO THE CAR STALLING UNEXPECTEDLY.I HAVE HAD TO OVERRIDE THAT FUNCTION WHICH INTURN DOES NOT SAVE GAS AS IT CLAIMS TO DO. FALSE ADVERTISING AND BLATANT FRAUD TO THE PUBLIC.
I would prefer a smoother leather finish like I have on my Lexus.  This rougher finish tends to show dirt and scuffs more.
Noise coming from cargo area with nothing stored in car.
Seems to be in the dash board under the storage compartment in X1 that does not have a gps/touch screen installed.
Cup holder is a separate plastic piece which sticks out and rubs against front seat passenger
Called BMW Assist. Gave me suggestions but still not working. Plan to bring to dealer; just havnt yet.
As a luxury expected to have trunk door open/close at a touch of button.
It's noisy and annoying; not able to drive without any music.
Braking is not stopping the vehicle at the time when applied.
It's a common problem in all BMW vehicles; dont understand why steering wheel is too tight.





WHEN I BACK OUT OF MY DRIVE WAY THE BRAKES ARE VERY SQUEAKY
FRONT RIMS ALWAYS SEEM DIRTY FROM BRAKE DUST
System has a lot of options and cannot always locate the sytem or access to what  I'm looking for at the time.

Run Flat tires came with car.  Salesman didn't adequately describe characteristics of them.





When hands are filled with groceries; it is very difficult to operate opening hatch.  When closing the handles are in an odd location.
The passenger side removable cup holder pushes cups out; unless they are small.  The center can not use styrofoam cups; because it tears them.
Sometimes the hatch doesn't fully latch although I feel like I have closed it with sufficient force . This has happened maybe two or three times.

I have to use i-drive to find out if tires are low
door lock button in certer of dash board not on the doors
worse radio I have ever had in an automobile; sound quality terrible.  BMW stated 'it is what it is'




manual adjustment is difficult to find the correct up/down and front/ back comfort level. prefer the automatic adjustment that I had in my 335d.
Cannot get a comfortable height adjustmen.  The seat adjusts on its own. Not a very smooth when trying to get the correct height that you want.
Specific sequence of commands is required---no flexibility.   Frequently misinterprets names for telephone calls.
I am 5'4'; so when I adjust the seat appropriately for me; it puts me too far forward to comfortably reach the center storage compartment.  I have to actually reach backward to get in it.
The tan interior carpet is much too light.  The floor mats are the same color.  I immediately purchased darker floor mats from AutoZone. I checked BMW website for rubber mats.  They were not yet available for this model.
I am short  so its probably an isolated problem...but I dont see a place to grip tailgate to close trunk on my small suv x1
The windshields  have numerous scratches.I don't trust getting the windshields replaced because it may lead to continual problems in the long run.
it has marks only by my knee lying against it

There is a button on the steering wheel with phone symbol; ideally when you press that button and speak the name; if it's connected to my phone then it should dial that person but seems like it's not working : When built-in hands free bluetooth is connected with my Samsung Galaxy Note 3; it can only transfer the phone audio not something I play on the phone. For instance; if I am playing music on my phone or listening messages on WhatsApp or anyother audio messages and when I select BMW Bluetooth from my phone menu then it doesn't transfer that audio. I guess either it's an issue or it's supposed to work with phone only
Rear hatch latch difficult to operate and I really need to slam the hatch shut to have it fully engage.
Rear wiper does not clear the entire window.
: The dashboard symbol which is a representation of an auto on a service lift appears on occasion particularly in very cold weather. The light goes off after several seconds but the engine did not start immediately on one occasion.
Gearshift is unnecessarily complicated.
manually sometimes it is hard to find the sweet spot within the exterior grip area that will open the latch; causing some moments of fumbling around. when using the key fob not sure if one push of the button is supposed to release latch; or two. often i end up holding the button too long and the panic siren starts. my wife shares these experiences as well. : often; after closing the rear hatch; the warning light will light up; indicating that the hatch hasn't fully closed. this is annoying enough; but recently; when it happened; i stopped at a red light; engine still running; and jumped out to re-close the hatch. i had closed the drivers door; as it was snowing and windy -- upon returning; i found the doors locked; even though i had not actively locked the doors at any time -- i was locked out! terrible design flaw !! fortunately i was close to home and my wife was able to come get me with the second key; but this could have been very very bad; if not dangerous -- SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN !!!: see prior comments re opening exterior hatch.

drivers side mirror -- cannot be moved far enough inward or downward to afford driver a comfortable view. driver must crane neck to see properly.  right side mirror is fine.
: not really a problem; but whenever i turn on the front defroster; the fan blows at 100% maximum. maybe this is deliberate; i just find it annoying and almost startling and violent.
the small storage compartment front and center in the dash  is hard to open. the angle of it; coupled with the little bar to push on and upward; doesn't make for enough traction betwwen itself and one's fingers to operate smoothly. needs to be a little tackier or better angled -- a minor frustration.
sticker indicates 22mpg city / 32 mpg hiway. from day one; has never delivered better than 14-15 city or 26-28 hiway. have now had the car 3 months / 2;000 miles and no change or improvement is occurring.very disappointing.
the fuel door when closed is not flush with the car
The steering wheel blocks the view of the speedometer. I need to look over the wheel to see the speed. I'd like to have a display of the speed available.

Does not accommodate larger size smartphones
Even using inside release or bottom on key the tailgate is hard to open.  Do not understand why BMW did not use avower lift gate or even offer on as an option.  Smaller; other brand; less expensive brands offer or have them as standard.  There certainly was room somewhere to put i.e. Mercedes GLA 250
Worked at first does not shut off any longer_ÔøΩÔøΩ.have not been to dealer due to excessive and frequent snow in Rhode Island
TOo structured in commands.  Some options not available
Does not recognize commands easily.   Too many steps to add in an address.  Cannot do verbally easy enough
Not large enough storage areas
I only get about 20 MPH in the city.  Seems a little low
You have to pull it 2 times to unlock and open the door when you stop the vehicle
rear hatch release is difficult to get your hands up into the area to touch squeeze the handle in order to open the hatch.  just unlocking it does not 'open' the hatch.  I never know if it is unlocked when I unlock the doors to the vehile
I never know if pushing the fob once unlocks it; pushing it 2 times; or holding it a long time.  I don't know how to unlock all the doors including the hatch from inside the vehicle
it is hard to reach because it is behind the elbow to get into it; you can't see it front the seat; have to lift another ledge to get into the actual larger storage.
again; like the storage compartment; it is back and the size is small and you have to bend your arm at an odd angle to get the cup out of the holder
the key doesn't click it open


don't know how to connect it to my phone

can't locate preferred view


squeaky
can move car with brake on
: not able to get full tank of gasoline @ some gas stations. . very weird.
Snow build up on wheels creates quiet a rough ride at highway speeds. In the northeast we have experienced a lot of snow this year.
On auto-up; the window would reach the top and go back down.  I had this problem for a couple of days but it seemed to fix itself.



It is difficult to see the speedometer.
This is an ongoing problem with all BMWs.  The voice recognition system cannot understand me; especially when the car is moving.
The center console contains a non-removeabler cradle for a non-iphone that takes up too much space and is a huge nuisance!!

keyless entry doesn't work on one of the keys given to me at time of delivery : one key not working back up camera not working communication system needed to be replaced within one month
: one key not working back up camera not working communication system needed to be replaced within one month
communication system stopped working within a month of delivery - had to be replaced
I have no idea how to use the holder for the cell phone and not sure if i was supposed to receive a charger or not but I did not






the brakes need improvement!! they feel like they slide; not grabbing. the car is still very new.  when I have more miles on it; I will bring it to the dealers attention.
radio drifts at times

the arm rest slides back and forth. the space provided for the cup holder is smaller than a normal coffee travel mug. the docking for the IPhone is NOT NEEDED. the USB in the console needs the wire to be exposed; no privacy if hooking up an Ipad. the space has no room for most things.
the larger holder; is on the side of the center console which gets in the way of the passenger. the cup holder under the arm rest is small.
I should be getting in the city over 20 miles to the gallon. Instead I am getting 15 - 17 miles to the gallon. highway driving should be over 30 miles to the gallon. I am getting 24 - 26 miles to the gallon.
the exhaust systems is loud on acceleration. loud under normal driving conditions.




I noticed it the next day after picking up the car but do not remember doing anything to cause it. Assuming it happened during preparation but have no proof.
There is no engine oil or water temperature gauge. Only warnings when outside the normal range.
Hear an occasional pop that sounds like a rock hitting the windshield.
One cup holder clips into place on the passengers side of the center console and the other gets covered over by the sliding center armrest. You have a choose of armrest  or the center cup holder. But not both.

Since the first day I brought my car home the voice recognition was not working.  I had to bring the car back to the dealer multiple times for them just to figure out the problem; which they said it was a faulty microphone.  The problem has finally been resolved.
Fuel gauge blend in too much and is too minimized to see clearly so it is easy to run low on gas and not realize it.  Bad location; should be up higher and more visible at a glance.
Car came with a dirt mark already on the passenger seat
This might just be my perception....but my previous 2011 328xi had a much tighter steering system which overall i preferred.  The x1 isn't bad; nor do I think there is anything defective; but I do not prefer the looser quality it displays.
Not sure if I am doing something wrong; but I would like all doors to open upon first click of the remote keyless entry...and I find the manual unlock button in the middle of the console  difficult to reach in certain circumstances....it is awkward.
I have made an appointment for service for this problem.  About three weeks ago i noticed sort of a 'high pitched' sound .  It almost sounds something like the  high pitched humming of a loose belt or something.  But it's an annoying sounds that occurs at any fan speed with the heat on.
I find the location of the front cup holder awkward.  I use the alternate  cup holder that you can clip into the holder manually because I find it easier to use when driving.  However; this cup holder takes up leg room from passengers.
I found that the trunk repeatedly was difficult to close. Also; it doesn't open well with the hidden exterior handle; requiring multiple presses to get it to open.
: sometimes the voice command of the navigation does not recognize my commands




Does not allow mirror to turn right
: Problem with blue tooth functionality
Lose one cup holder when using arm rest. : the cup holder situation is a design problem. I have designed and made an additional arm rest.



problem with locking





: On two occasions when the car was parked unlocked in my locked garage the alarm has gone off with siren sounding and lights flashing. This occurred when the car was unlocked and the alarm system was not armed. It did not register on the computer survey of alarm trips. Car is currently at the dealer. They have not yet been able to replicate the problem. Working diagnosis is possible faulty key sending a faulty panic signal to the car.
part of not being a complete sytem. Too complicated to look up address while driving.
New streets not listed; new businesses not listed; old businesses intermittently found

hatch latch doesnt consistently close and lock
awkward placement and when not in use-no where convenient to store it.
Need to really slam the hatch shut for it to not indicate open hatch on the instrument panel.
Strange noise during cold days when decelerating. Stops when idle.
Hard to reach for short woman to close and hand hold not effective.  no way to fix or repair system

Texts from years ago show up. Synced contacts merged multiple names in my phone
Seems to catch on something and not want to open. Have to try a few times sometimes. We are taking it in to be looked at. : the trunk does not open easily. gets caught on something - even when it is completely empty.
Maybe an issue with operator error ; but darn if we can get it to say anything when we drift across lanes without signaling. We have a 'new owner class' coming up and will address it there.
Took into the dealer on day two. They fixed it immediately.



Rear windshield not does sweep entire window - design flaw
Will not recognize phonebook and book tooth does not alwasy connect
the area designation fro the phone is waited space!!  Never use it-would rather have a larger area for storage.  Was told that the phone holder could be removed for at least $75
Too many functions on one control make it difficult to understand how to use the rear wipers. Not intiutive
Unable to figure out how to change speed without turning cruise control off and resetting it.
Navigation issues covered in previous question.  System does not interpret names of contacts correctly ever.  Have stopped using voice recognition for phone.  Now I go to the phone menu and select redial and scroll through the list to find who I want to call.
Pairing with phone is slow and it will sometimes  drop pairing while driving .  Does not ring on my end daily when I first call people.  I have to hang up and then wait for them to call me back.  I do not make important business calls from the car because of this.  I only call personal contacts who understand this is how the system seems to work.
Interpretation of voice for addresses wrong every time try to use.  Do not speak with an accent.
Traffic does not update to situation.  Traffic info only available on freeways.  Able to get street traffic conditions on other platforms; but not on this one.

The problem occurs when I rely on the hatch to sense that I have the key when I put my hand in the hatch handle slot.  It doesn't respond consistently; and I usually have to 'jiggle around' with it to get the latch to release so I can pull the hatch open.  This does not happen when I use the button on the key to 'pop' the hatch before I reach into the hatch handle slot to pull the hatch open.
I garage my car and hang both keyless fobs on a hook whenever I am at home.  Nevertheless; I have found all the doors and windows; including sun roof; to be open approximately 10 times in the four months I have had the car.  This has not happened yet at any other time - only at home in the garage.  I am working through the BMW owner videos and have not yet raised the issue with the dealer.  Perhaps there is a way to turn this feature off via the computer system.  Very annoying.
2nd cup holder is a temporary one.  Everytime I have to use it I have to put it in place.  Normally stores in center console
Have to reset frequently





having difficulty understanding how to manage the wiper speed changes--however must admit I have not accessed the manual yet
small cover  fell off and I am not sure how to re-attach wipers difficult to adjust difficult to exit out of vehicle without back of calf rubbing door frame. In the winter; black pants become laced with salt.
: XM Radio in this car is the worst sounding satellite radio I have ever heard.

While I didn't purchase the vehicle for cup holder convenience I find it absurd that I must use an adapter attachment in order to use the cup holder away from my elbow. I really love the BMW ride but the X11 is severely lacking in this one very minor area. The permanent cup holder is almost behind your elbow. Very very awkward.
I'm 4.8 and when it opens it's hard for me to reach it to close the trunk.



Having to remove the extra cup holder from the middle console and attach it...too much work.
The interior tailgate 'open' button is in a place difficult to see unless the drivers door is open. The exterior 'open' button is sometimes hard to find.

I've experienced a few times when speaking on the phone in the car; then leaving the car but continue talking on the phone; the Bluetooth in the car seems to take over and I can't speak on the cell unless getting back into the car.
The center console is lame; needs more storage capacity and absolutely needs to be higher in order to provide comfort as an armrest; which in fact it also is. It's way too low on All the BMW models I looked at!!! Bad feature. VW does a better job in this area than BMW!
It's hard to believe that for the high price of BMW's; the sun visors are ridiculous! They are too small; and should have a sliding mechanism and double smaller visor to shield the sun; as do most Japanese cars.
I have less than 6 k miles and am very disappointed that there are little blemishes/ chips already!!!
whoever had cleaned the car had obviously used something that had smeered some kind of oil or grease all over the interior of the windscreen.  it took me weeks of cleaning to be able to finally get it off and it's still not as clear as i would like
Paint chipped near rear tail light
Large scratch noted to bottom of instrument panel on the clear cover part that protects the gauges
Noise appears to be coming from the upper part of the door panel near where the door panel and the glass meet but also seems like it maybe be near the panel and glass where the door lock comes out. The noise is for sure near the drivers shoulder area of the car
I suspect the noise is caused by poorly designed wind deflector. There are handle-like indentations on the deflector frame; which could cause the noise.
: I use car's Bluetooth primary to real text messages and sometimes to reply. Every time I get a new text message; connection quality deteriorates to nothing; making the feature useless. I had to set my phone to use 'Alternative Bluetooth audio connection' to improve audio quality. Now it looks like a phone call on the car screen. The call volume resets to medium every time I get a new call; in a convertible it's too quiet.  The car can play MP3 files from a USB stick. I have not been able to make it play .m3u or .m3u8 playlists. When I navigate to the playlist menu; it loads the list for at least a minute and then shows no items. Car fails to play some mp3 files which I can play on other devices.

Front seatbelts are designed with no height adjustment option. They are uncomfortable for a short person. With the top down; seatbelt flaps in the wind at 50+ mph; slapping driver's left shoulder.
: The A/C turns itself on every time the car is started. It's a convertible; there is no need to run A/C if the top is down. As I've been told at the dealership; it's to force air through the vent system. In this case they could turn it off in a few seconds.  The drive mode goes to comfort every time the car is started. Need to keep it in Sport. I've been told at the dealership that it's because the vehicle is not designed to be driven all the time in Sport mode.
In the 2 months I owned the car I've never seen the engine shut down. All the BMW service folks can say is that there are multiple conditions to meet to shut down the engine.
This is the first BMW--I have owned 32 before--that has electric steering versus hydraulic steering. I find that under 50 mph and in comfort mode; the steering is excessively boosted; thus lacking the solid road feel I experienced with all my prior BMWs. If the sport or sport+ driving modes are selected; the steering is considerably firmer but this is not the mode I prefer to drive in slow; urban traffic.
NOT SURE HOW TO USE THE LOCK. SEEMS I HAVE TROUBLE WITH THIS. IT TAKES 3 CLICKS TO WORK
SEEMS TO GET STUCK AND I HAVE TO KEEP PULLING AND JIGGLING TO GET IT TO RELEASE : SEAT BELT GETS STUCK OFTEN
Due to the proximity of the seat to the steering wheel and the door; when the driver and passengers exit the vehicle the interior of the scuff plate and the bottom inside quarter panel trim next to the feet get marked up getting out of the car.  This is a very minor/minor nuance.
Cover for the Windshield wiper area was faded and discolored. Like bleached..
Speed Volume Control increases volume all over the place when driving at highway speeds. I have adjusted all settings to try to adjust the levels; with no results
Engine would just turn over; and not start. Like as if no gas was getting to the engine..This happened 3 times to my knowledge; once at delivery by the salesman; once on day #1 of ownership; and  the same on day #2 of ownership. The car started after a few attempts; and was brought to the dealer who needed to perform a software update.
The lever is at the corner where the seat back meets the seat bottom; and the seat belt covers the lever
blemishes that we can't rub out.
it just not an expensive car and its small so you hear a lot more noise.
: The controls for the stereo system are not very clear and the controls to move to the next song on the usb setting doesn't work.
: The controls for the stereo system are not very clear and the controls to move to the next song on the usb setting doesn't work.
Hatch closes too hard...needs some kind of buffer to prevent the slamming sound.
might be being picky but driver's side window seems to have excessive wind noise even though it's working properly.
Hidden behind steering wheel
The door lock button on the door handle is a bit confusing and takes and few presses for it to lock.
The steering wheel blocks the air vents also vents are not that strong or powerful.
I hace noticed when switching from reverse to drive the shift is a bit rough with a slight jerk. Sometimes it happens when I'm slowing down and I slowly proceed.
Awkward user interface; too many steps; automatic restriction of entry choices prevents entering some addresses.  Control is touchy; makes inadvertent entries.
Just sitting turning steering back and forth just seems there is play
Just does not work really bad
The ac vents for driver are being blocked by the steering wheel you can't feel the cool air. : Air condition vents are blocked by steering wheel does not blow on driver
Just odd shape really dies not hokd; alot
Just needs to be a little deeper really size dies nit hold a lot of items closing lid with stuff in it.
When first started and drive there's a delay in take off; shifting little hard when cold. Changing into sport modes and going back to regular mid mode it shifts rough hard down shift or up shift sometimes.
See before comments : Acceleration delays when cold some times when warm
: Seat belt is difficult to reach.
Not a serious issue; and may just be that I'm not used to driving with an automatic transmission.  The car moves forward when I release the brake.  This may be normal.  I plan to ask about in at first maintenance.


Compared to my previous Mini ; and travel the same distance daily; I refuel more often; it's the same Mini Cooper 'S'; just different year - 2012 & 2015.

Actually I have received a message 4 differnt times saying that the system was malfunctioning.  Then the message seems to go away after 10 minutes or so.
The problem appears to be related to the trim around the belt-line and the molding around the roof. the panels and hatch line up nicely but the trim on the separate pieces do not line up well at all with their counterparts. I have not taken this to my dealer because I do not expect that they can adequately address it and am afraid that in the process things will worsen.
The front driver's side hood exhibits a faint abrasion of 15 cm diameter near the headlamp opening. Both driver and passenger quarters show traces of what appears to be a finger-print sized patch of adhesive that may be a byproduct of the installation of decorative 'scuttle' accents. The rear passenger quarter; between the fuel door and the tail light; show four very small spots that appear to be droplets or splash that have permanently marked the paint. I have not taken this to my dealer because I do not expect that they can adequately address it and am afraid that in the process things will worsen.
I purchased the storage package option. With it comes an adjustable floor/lid for the rear storage compartment . I prefer to keep this 'cover' in the top most position; however; when it is opened its design is such that it slides down into the clips for the lower adjustment position. I suppose this is not mush of an issue for most however I have limited strength and function in my hands and trying to disengage that lid from those clips is a frustrating exercise. Having a clip mechanism for the lid in its upper position would be a huge convenience; from my perspective. I have not taken this to my dealer because it is a design issue.
Again; I am an unusual case and I am sure few people have this problem. As I mentioned earlier; my hands have limited strength and function. As a result; the location of the shifter lock button makes it imposable for me to depress it with a single hand. Because I also drive with hand-controls; I must hold the brake with my left hand and perform the shifting of the lever into drive with my right. I have taken a black plastic 'zip-tie' and fastened it around the shifter knob so as to permanently depress the shifter button. I am not sure of what may be done about this; if anything; but in an effort to make the world a more accessible place I thought I should let you know.
There is only a narrow gap between the brake pedal and the center console for the gas pedal. Sometimes I hit both pedals when I mean to use only the gas pedal.
The head-up display is incompatible with polarized sunglasses. Given that all other LCD displays are not incompatible with polarized sunglasses this is a ridiculous engineering oversight and it prohibits my use of this extra-cost feature except at night.
On one and only one occasion I was unable to shift out of park. Letting the car sit untouched for 15-20 minutes apparently resolved the issue.
Multiple handles to pull and adjust. Difficult to remember which one is for what; especially on outside of seats 
as stated before

Door doesn't always close fully; compared to passenger door.
: USB port stopped working
dose no cover enough area; needs some what of fish eye mirror
hard to adjust. does ont go over far enough.
pares then un pairs then pares again. back and forth : in and out paring of device; no voice activation without buying navigation packagr
the console in the middle makes it harder to buckle up
Not a huge deal. Control for forward/backward is sometimes confused with seat length control.
ARM REST IS ADJUSTABLE BUT SITS RIGHT ABOVE HAND BRAKE. DIFFICULT TO USE HAND BRAKE DUE TO ARM REST. IF ARM REST IS IN LOWEST POSITION INTERFERES WITH HAND BRAKE.
USE AUTOMATIC SETTING MOST TIMES BECAUSE CONTROLS FOR WIPERS ARE NOT INTUITIVE. DIFFICULT TO SEE BEHIND STEERING WHEEL.
TURN SIGNALS HAVE TWO 'BUMPS'. ONE FOR THREE BLINK AND ONE FOR CONTINUOUS. OPERATION IS DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY SELECT BLINK PATTERN. LEVER DOES NOT STAY IN POSITION. WOULD PREFER IF LEVER STAYED IN POSITION - MORE TACTILE FUNCTION. TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO.
CLOCK LOCATED ON CONSOLE BEHIND STEERING WHEEL. SMALL FONT. DIFFICULT TO SEE. WOULD PREFER SEPARATE LOCATION ON OWN-ISOLATED. SUCH AS NEAR REAR OR ON VIEW MIRROR.
ON SIDE OF SEAT - DIFFICULT TO ADJUST. MUST ADJUST WHEN VEHICLE IS PARKED.
: COOLING FOR NORMAL OPERATION IS NOT EFFECTIVE. MUST USE A/C OR MAX A/C SETTING TO EXPERIENCE SUFFICIENT COOLING. FAN UNDERPOWERED. MUST SET FAN AT HIGH ROTATION IN ORDER FOR TEMPERATURE TO REMAIN CONSISTENT.
WHEN SUN ROOF OPEN ODOR FROM VEHICLE ENTERS PASSENGER COMPARTMENT. MAY BE ENGINE GETTING WORKED IN BUT HAS AN 'OFF' SMELL LIKE HOT INSULATION OR WIRES. PLAN ON REVIEWING WITH DEALER AT NEXT SERVICE INTERVAL.
: The audio portion of the navigation system cannot be heard very well above the radio if the radio is on.
It is very difficult for the passenger to engage and disengage the seatbelt due to the very limited space and the physical location of the seat belt buckle.  The buckle sits too far back and its hard to get the belt clip into the buckle.
They are run-flat tires; they are noisy and the ride is ROUGH...I had to replace one tire at 2200 miles due to a leak. Worst thing they could have designed for such a great vehicle.

Black spots
Markks by door from shoes
Getting in and out if you bump the panel it scratches and will not clean off.
: Navigation system won't display 'standard color' option.  Only displays 'alternate' color scheme.
Poor location and it hard to connect.
The factory installed RFT 17' tire has extremely bad handling on winter road. The car should come out with winter tire option when sold during winter season.
The car has an option to auto-lock when the car is moving above certain speed. If this feature is enabled; locking the car via keyless method is affected in the following scenario:  If one get off the vehicle without manually unlocking the door; it will take multiple pressing of the door lock button to get the car door to lock. This is because the first press will 'unlock' the already unlocked door; then the second or third press will eventually lock the door.   This is resolved if: 1. The passenger side door also opened and closed prior attempt of locking. 2. The door is manually unlocked prior to getting off the vehicle.
Even after adjustment; the display sometimes easily obstructed by the steering wheel depending on how one sit on the driver's seat. The angle needs improvement.
No pause button for any music or media No CD control for single/repeat/shuffle/random/ff/rr; nothing. Does not come with any CD player whatsoever and requires a CD changer add-on at premium price. : Car only offer DVD changer which take up most of the premium space in the glove compartment. The DVD changer only plays music CD and fail to recognize or play any DVD movies or media even when the car is parked.
Wrong city or wrong zipcode or address simply does not exist.
Recliner adjustment closely covered by seatbelt when the belt is fastened. This is by design; not a defect.
: Fuel door gets pulled open in Car Wash.
very confusing to pair bluetooth playlist.  Too many steps to go thru to get it to start
Somewhat better after dealer found my phone and husbands phone occupied the #1 slot.  Fixed that but after his phone has been playing and I drive alone and try to play my phone there are many steps to go thru to restart mine.  Too distracting to do while driving so I will pull over to fix it.
Rear driver side seat head rest...The small black side button that is pushed to lay the headrest flat for better view....that button came off on 2nd use and would not stay on.  Called dealer and   a whole new heads rest was ordered.  I have an appointment to get it installed next week.
Silver gray seats pick up black from black pants and blue from jeans.  I did get the extend coverage/treatment to protect seats and will be cleaned if stained.
The leather seats came with extended support area for legs.  This support is about 1 inch too much.  No matter how I or My husband adjusts it...it hits directly behind the knees and gets VERY uncomfortable on a long drive. Did mention to the dealer but it is a fixed part of the seat and cannot be changed.  So nothing to fix or adjust.  Just Poor design.  Also Manual seat adjusting is very tedious and difficult to get back to my position after husband drives.  Would never buy a vehicle with Manual seats again.
The driver's side seat-back had a minor but noticeable scratch in the leather. The dealer noted the damage and ordered a replacement part immediately.  The part is now in and will be replaced at my convenience; with a loaner car being provided. The Salesman I worked with was very good about contacting me every week as to the replacement part's arrival.
: THE EL SCREEN GOES BLANK AND SAYS NO SIGNAL FOR NO REASON EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THEN REBOOTS AND COMES BACK ON
at any speed; takes more effort or force on the pedal to adequately stop and keep distance with the other car in front. however after learning the quirks of the car;it becomes not a big issue.
Even pulling into the school parking lot I have poor reception on simple stations like 95.1 99.1 102.7; etc
It told me the battery was discharged when the car was stopped. I drove around to charge it and it still didn't charge and when I got home the interior and screen lights started shutting off and wouldn't light up anymore. : My battery was discharged because there wasn't a system update on the car.
transmission not smooth; surges sometimes. this is the only bad thing I can say about this car! it is also probably the only part BMW did not have a hand in developing; hopefully future transmissions work as they should.
same as other comment

Plastic door panels  seem to scratch simply by being bumped
Might be the way they're supposed to be; but when the high beams come on the low beams go off; so you don't get a good view of the road ahead.
Clock is slow.  I have to adjust it about a minute every week
The time that is displayed is too small for me to read it; on both the dash and the center dash.
I have to apply a ridiculous amount of pressure to get the horn to sound.  Would not be effective in an emergency.
The lever is behind the seat belt when you are belted in.  Had to look in the manual to figure out where it is. Difficult to adjust when you are driving.
Virtually every passenger I've had have had a lot of trouble buckling the passenger front seat belt.  They just can't find the clasp.


the lever is in a tight spot and every passenger I have had in the seat complained about it or could not locate it.
difficult to locate
Turbo noise. This started on my 3rd day and was random. Took into dealer when it was making the noise. Turbo needed to be replaced.
Controls located at bottom of dash and hard-to-read.
I don't know how to operate the 'dual climate zones' properly.  I can make the heater work; but I'm sure I'm not using correctly.
My car is a hatchback.  We always have the rear seats folded forward and use the rear compartment for luggage; groceries; etc. The panel/cover that covers the 'lower storage compartment' tend to rattle and buzz -- nearly all of the time. I need to check it out further and probably will be able to solve the problem by wedging in a piece of foam or something on one or more of the edges of the vibrating panel/cover.
: After rainy weather or wash car; then open windows and close them; there is significant streaks on the windows that are oily in nature.  I took to dealer and they replaced the rubber and brushes that guide the windows as they are opened/closed. Fixed now
I had the exterior protection added at time of purchase. When they detailed the car they caused many  scratches across the back bumper. They attempted to buff out; but only was able to remove about 80% of them; but while they fixed those; the result was swirl marks. I elected to take care of it myself as I had very little confidence in the dealer making it better.
For the MINI; when you add a sunroof ; they remove the dome light. This is a bad idea.
The head light and fog light controls are located in a very poor location. I have automatic head lights; so that is not so bad; but I drive most of the time in rural areas with my fog lights on. It  is hard to located the button to turn them on.  Also; should be able to run my fog lights with my bright lights.
: This refers to the bluetooth/usb integration with my iPhone using Mini Connected package. They claimed seamless integration. First; it has to be physically connected . They should be able to use a wireless bluetooth connection. When using bluetooth; there are many delays in recognizing the iPhone. Sometimes it takes 2-3 minutes before I can play music via bluetooth. Again; I upgraded to the better Mini Connected and many of the functions advertised like using the steering wheel controls to skip ahead in music and it follows along on the dash do not work with bluetooth. Can't even use the steering controls to skip ahead. I have to use the controls on the dash media player.
First the nav system doesn't recognize when you use voice commands like 'map to 123 North Street in Folsom'. It rarely is able to get even close to the parts  Second; to manually enter an address; it takes several minutes to scroll around to spell out the pieces of the address.  Third; the nav system attempts to narrow selections down as you fill them in. However; there are many addresses that the nav system doesn't have; but could get close enough to work; but many times its hard to figure out what to pick to get you that close. I end up using my iPhone instead.
Two issues: 1. My MINI has dual control. However; I drive mostly by myself . When I want to adjust the temp up or down; I end up changing both dials. They should have a 'sync' button like many other manufacturers so changing the driver side; changes both.  2. MINI cleverly has a in-dash vent. It operates with the vents that point at my face. I would like to be able to control whether that is on or off.
The noise was by the driver's door handle. It took two visits to the dealer to get fixed. I would say its 90% fixed now.
MINI is a small car. I think more thought to having the best storage is mandatory. Its seems like an after thought. The glove box is small and shallow. When you open it during driving; things just fall out.
I have MINI all weather  floor mats. For me; the goal of rubber mats is to be more durable; deal with wet; muddy situations. I had a previous MINI and had the same and the style and fit was great. They came up on the sides of the foot wells and trap all wet type stuff. My new MINI rubber mats are much different. They went for 'style' instead of function. They are flatter and have more decorative things. In turn; these don't trap the water/mud/stuff and keep on the mat.
: The rear sunroof shade rattles badly when retracted.  If the shade is closed; no issue.  I took in back for service and was informed that Mini already had a bulletin and a fix.  The fix lasted only a few days.  I will probably fix this myself.  For now I leave the shade closed.

when i turn the car on; it occasionally makes a rattling noise.  It goes away after about 30 seconds.
This problem has just presented in the last week  I will arrange to have dealership look at it

need to push hard to open the latch
: navigation system voice is too low
I would like the drivers seat headrest to adjust back; not just up or down : just head rest
it's only when I start driving. It may be that it is locking
hard to reach due to fact my drivers seat needs to be close to front of car
I thought it would get better gas mileage; but I think it's because i now have a turbo
I found the chip at delivery.
No matter how I place objects into the glove box; they always slide out. It isn't a mechanical problem but rather a design flaw. My previous MINI had the same issue.
It's not a major problem; but I never had this problem with my 2007 R56 S.  Occasionally; it is difficult to put it into 1st gear from neutral.  This sometimes leads to a slight grind.  It's nothing major; but it is a surprise.
A valve stem was leaking





I am sure the GPS is powerful but I am not able to figure it all out. There is no printed manual or anything on line that I have found. The tech person could not explain what stored destinations are or how it works.
: When locking from outside using pushbutton; have to press button several times to lock or unlock. Remote locking/unlocking works fine.  Dealer changed battery in remote but did not improve pressing outside door button for locking/unlocking.  Problem occurs on both doors.
The gas pedal is so close to the center console that you have to contort your body while driving.  In heavy traffic of long durations it can really make your back hurt.
The black seats show soil easily.

it would be great that the all doors unlocked with one touch in keyless entry so when locking them it would take one push to lock all doors




Can't charge it and get it to play music on Pandora
Still unable to give navigation voice commands.  Can not get it to find a particular point of interest...ie restaurants; stores

This is my second Mini Cooper and the navigation system is much better BUT doesn't not give me any time to make the turn.  Gives the command at the last minute and very vague on her commands 

Whenever anyone is wearing denim or dark clothing ; the blue dye rubs off easy and discolors the seat material and looks bad.  Very disappointing...
Seems to make more noise when I press on the headliner.....
The seats are light in color and show scuffs and dirt.
Wish there was a better information system on how to operate this car in general.  I got locked out twice--had the key fob in my purse-didn't realize it had to be very close to engage the system  MINI NEEDS TO DO A BETTER JOB OF FEATURE BENEFITS--I HAVE READ THE MANUEL MANY TIMES AND IT JUST ISN'T CLEAR--ESPECIALLY FOR THE COMPUTER SYSTEM AND DOOR LOCKS
Still not sure how to shut off the car?  Have to play with the toggle switch--sometimes the interior stays on for an extended time period.
Very difficult to find; especially on the passenger side they are on seat side but in the back--

When I first got the car; no one even at the MINI club could get the windows to stay clear--now; I open the windows; turn on the fan from auto to manual; turn up the air conditioner first and then heat   No where in manual does it tell you haw to defrost windows

Brakes seem weak compared to power of car engine - I took it in and they said it was normal.
Even though I read the book; I can't seem to manually set radio stations or set presets without getting out the book again.

The gear shift button fell off.  It is the button that needs to be pushed to change shifter positions.




passenger airbag light comes on when there is no passenger in the seat.  this should be explained otherwise you think it is a malfunction.  when i took it to mini repair they told me that I had to schedule an all day appt to have it checked. This is a feature not a bug; but it seems like a bug because of poor communication
cant find it on the menu.  was never demonstrated during training.  waste of money

incorrect in portland and san francisco

no rear controls
air only works well when on Max AC
automatic speed and rain sensing vs manual is unclear and difficult to explain to a new driver so you often end up with wrong speed of wipers for conditions.
EVERY  new driver in car makes same mistakes trying figure which 'buttons' control the Left Right function and which control the mirror adjustments. Choosing the wrong button obvious only after seeing mirror 'adjusted' was the wrong one causing more re-adjustment.
info shows up too small on speedo. Info on center display is adequate but you have to go through 2-3 menu screens after EVERY start to get to the vehicle info screen.
display of secondary information on speedo is too small and light font to read quickly especially if one needs reading glasses... we are not all 20 year olds
: radio digital FM has frequent echo in marginal reception areas
icons too small and in a row of same size buttons that is hard to differ when driving
If the part of the seatbelt mechanism that was attached to the side wall had an adjustment to slide up and down to adjust for the drivers height it would alleviate the belt sliding up to my neck.
I took it in for service and the problem was corrected -- something about not enough padding.
The use mechanism is not intuitive.  Honestly; I haven't looked at the manual though.  The push button device on the control which allows the wipers to self-regulate is a good feature but it seems to stop working after a while; i.e.; turn off while still raining.  I am probably not doing something correctly.
There are so many levers you don't know which one to use.



: Our tire in need of replace due to bubble in the car. when they replaced the new tire; the tire pressure indicates that the new tire has a very low tire pressure. When I brought it into the dealer; the mechanic says the tire pressure indicates on the monitor is not accurate.

Within 2 months of obtaining a new car; we experienced a problem where the ignition would not start the engine. Hence; we needed to have our car towed.
Vibration from road conditions has loosened the screw
: I haven't brought the car back yet.  A hesitation - followed by a lurch - ocurs in  green mode after I've come to a stop and released my foot from the break.  It is less noticeable in mid mode.


When locking the doors at the drivers side; when you push the lock button;it will not lock the doors the first time you push the button. You must push it 2 or 3 times to lock the car.
You can't put a pillow on the seat for a short person. If you do; the indicator light stays on.
For a short person; you can't put the display high enough to see it.
Location too recessed to insert USB stick easily. Design issue. Also it is a storage area that might easily damage the port or stick if items are stored with stick installed
Not sure if the tie was defective or if I hit a pothole. I live in the Northeast and the road are in bad shape
IT IS NOT USER FRIENDLY; EASIER TO SAVE ADDRESS IN PREVIOUS CAR  TAKES A WHILE TO ENTER ADDRESS; DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT HOW TO STOP GUIDANCE
it is set back so far that it has been hard for passengers to reach.  Especially when the center console is down
They are not bright enough for my taste.


Hard to find buckle; seat belt cuts into my neck
My check engine light came on. Took to dealer and was told it was due to poor fuel quality although I had only put Supreme Unleaded in it.

When it is raining and you open either door; water runs off the roof and onto the interior seat.




Located too low and too much in the back Difficult to reach
I was informed that I let it go too quickly.
When you brake for now; this is my third mini cooper and previous slow excellent
When you brake for now; this is my third mini cooper and previous slow excellent
every time I take a baden or take a hole in the road. so at lished in the three mini I've had
: WIPERS / WASHERS some not 100% clean and has noise sometime occasions. The automatic system was the best we have.
: no light passenger for the back; or in the middle of the car as is typical
: The Restraint belt bends at the top and gets stuck and is very dififil removing it.
: It takes time to heat the heating; I still have not tried the cooling.
: Yellow engine light reported earlier: The engine warning light came on; diagnostic tester showed P1300; MINI service could not say what that means; after 2 days; light went off; now it has reappeared. Vehicle operation appears normal. I made an appointment; but the light went off before the appointed date.
Very awkward method of dimming mirror.  Twist turn is more difficult than a simple push-pull system would be.
: Voice recognition sometimes misinterprets.  Your question re: 'frequently' misinterprets isn't accurate as it is only sometimes.  I don't feel this is a big problem but just what can reasonably be expected from a still developing technology.
: There was debris inside the LED color ring and the dealership had to remove it.
The noise is a hum or buzz from the left front dashborad under certain vibration conditions from the engine or stereo.
Difficult to switch from satellite radio to iphone.
: The car always starts with the heater on even when I have turned it off as soon as I start the car.
: Within the first 2 months of owning the car my windshield has been cracked three times. Not strong enough glass or too low to the ground?
Door panel on driver's side is scuffed. Hard to clean

Go drive should link up with the phone not Aux port
When on Safari on the phone it goes to the car and cannot play any music safari takes over sometimes the phone won't link up to the car.
When I get out of my car my foot snags on the panel where the door closes at the bottom it has messed up my foot and shoes it catches on them this is the second time but they are replacing it
already explained it to you
Its doesn't understand me.  I try to speak very distinctly but now I just stop and put it in by hand with the computer.
The words Decreased Battery Power came on for 3 days.  I called & made an appointment.  The service man said it was safe to drive.  I drove it and on the second day the navigator came back on and everything is fine.  I don't know why it did that.  I only had the car for 3 months.  It's a great car.  I'm going to call and cancel my appointment to get it checked.
This happened twice. Technician verified car was functioning properly and re-calibrated the system.  Has not happened since.
Hood handle is difficult for me to pull for a release. A man has to do it for me.
: Seat belt is so far back of driver because this is a two door vehicle. One must grasp belt while door is open in order not to hurt/strain shoulder muscles. I learn there is an attachment whcih hook s on the head rest. I am considering it; but think the attachment should be part of standard equipment. 
panel indicated low tire; had tires checked and proper air installed; indicated low tires again -- had rechecked. Panel computer system is showing 4 low tires; etc.; even the radio comes on with a narrative about tire pressure and nothing is wrong. I am calling the dealer; in part due to recall notice received regarding tire pressure/federal standards.
: had trouble resetting clock to daylight savings; but after a while; I figured it out.

BUCKEL PORTION OF THR BELT SHOULD BE EXTENDED TWO TO THREE INCHES
Won't open manually; only with interior button. Next time I go to the dealer; I'll have them look at it.
On cold days; vehicle takes longer to pair or won't pair at all
Heater cannot maintain temperature if outside temp is below 17 degrees. won't defrost very fast.
Heater does not get hot very fast unless temp is more than 32 outside.
Materials scuff easily; but dirt washes off with a little scrubbing.







The button on the driver's side does not open and lock with one push; however; the passenger side does.
Not happy with the use of on board computer's reading of the speedometer.  When in use there is a loss of the odometer.  I have to switch out of the computer's speedometer reading to find the odometer's reading - very inconvenient and a poor design choice.
It's not really a defect; However; I did receive a RECALL for a 'tire info' sticker. I just feel that the 175/65/15 for this vehicle is to tall and the tread width is also to narrow for this vehicle.  I received recall 3 days after I took delivery of car.
From first day engine had a surge just before stopping; I felt it was just the turbo and engine adjusting to driving habits. And it seems to be all but gone. Using premium fuel and getting great mileage. So not problem I will bring to dealership unless come back and I feel it won't.
heavy-have to tug hard
squeaks
Water seems to get inside the door panel easily on the driver's side. The window is then foggy on the outside from the residue. Seems to happen mostly when the car is washed.
The paint seems to be a weak point. The car had significant scratches almost immediately. In one case; a dog jumped up to look in the car window; and that caused scratches AND a ding; which was really surprising.
I was surprised at how quickly the windshield glass got scratched. There is an inch long visible scratch; and lots of little nicks. Since I got the car in January; I guess it is from road salt.
The auto/rain sensor doesn't work very well. The 'fast-slow' slider doesn't seem to have much effect. In auto it either doesn't sense the rain and I end up manually triggering the wipers; or it will suddenly wipe extremely fast for no apparent reason. Too bad; since my only other options are very high speed or high speed - no real low wiper speed. I end up fiddling with the controls a lot when it rains.
The difference between soft touch  and full turn signal is subtle. I often only want the 3 blinks; go to far; try to toggle off and end up triggering the opposite turn signal. So I end up fiddling with the controls a lot.
I think it might be the cargo area cover. it almost sounds like something is bumping into the back of the car;which is a bit startling.

When I have the auto engine off feature disabled; and I come to a complete stop; it stumbles. As if it is trying to turn off anyway.
I notice it when I have lifted my foot from the gas; or braked slightly; then push the gas to speed up again. As if I've taken it out of gear; and it takes a minute to re-engage.
: tilt steering wheel does not have enough adjustment travel
I easily confuse the wiper controls whether confusing rear and front or wash and wipe.  Will often have to take eyes off road to verify what direction to move dial/stalk or which tap to flip to access desired function usually after activating unwanted function
not only are ports obstructed but any connection wires are required to track in inconvenient paths and become entangled with gear shift and wires obstruct cup holders

may just be not used to yet but often confuse recliner adjustment for height adjustment and vice versa
confuse height lever with recliner lever
may not be feature in this Mini  but in previous Mini when you grasp the lever for front seats to fold forward to gain access to rear seats the front seats would not only fold but slide forward to open space for rear seat access and then seat would resume previous postion on both axis when seat back was folded back upright.  This Mini does not seem to have this capability and seat must be adjusted on both axis individually when either gaining access to rear seats or when want to resume previous postion
minor irritant; I chalk it up to small size of cabin space so change in humidity really effects; clears very quickly with adjustment of fan/temp/air con.
Orange engine light came on within first month after taking delivery of car.  Dealerhip contacted and told to see if it would go off by itself in a day or too.  It did.  Dealership asked if there might be a loose gas cap.  I indicated no; as I am aware of this issue and always tighten the gas cap after any fill-up.  Person at dealership indicated this might not be a big problem as it had happen to her Mini car and the orange engine light went off by itself.  It has happened a second time now and am waiting to see if it will go off by itself.  In both instances where the orange engine light has come on the fuel gauge has indicated just less than half full. : Orange engine light has come on several times now and car has just turned 600 miles.  The first time the orange engine light came on it stayed on for four days.  Less than 300 miles on car.  Dealer was contacted and advised.  Dealer suggested waiting a couple of day to see if it would go off by its self.  It did go off after about four days.  The second time it came on was at approximately 600 miles and has been on for four days now.  I have not driven the car since the fourth day of the second orange light issue.  I have not contacted the dealer about the second orange engine light experience.  Waiting to see if the orange engine light will go off by itself again the next time I drive the vehicle.  If it does not go off by its self; I will contact the dealer again for the second occurance.
Went to have someone look at it and try to connect it..need to come back for an appointment to have it looked at.
Since my CD player was placed in the glove compartment; there is little room for storage
Not sure where odor is coming from...sometimes it is very slight.
Showed I had low oil...I brought it in to the dealer and there was no leak...oil seems fine...not sure why this happened
Did not seem to be a problem
When the phone is connected to the audio through Bluetooth. Many times it will automatically make calls and disconnect continuously; until I turn off my phone and turn it back on. Sometimes it will continue this after I have turned my phone on and off again.

Seems to get white marks on the seats easily. Not sure what the source is. I have few passengers n the car. The marks will fade using cleaner; but still remains very lightly.
With the controls set to a specific temperature and the fan control set to auto; the car doesn't seem to maintain the desired temperature. The car seems significantly warmer than the set temperature. I have another car with the same feature and setting both cars on the same temperature results in very different ambient temperatures.
Commented on previous page
Front cup holders are so close to the gear shift that I hit the cups when I shift.
Sometimes; it just will not close properly and the lights stay on the trunk open light comes on and I have to pull over and attempt to close it again.

I have had several stick shifts in the past and I have never had one cause so much difficulty to  get into reverse. It does not grind it is just really tough to push over and get in gear. It has loosened and become a little easier but still very difficult.
no comment

I don't understand the directions.
Seatbelt position causes shoulder belt to rub neck. No adjustment available
This is my second MINI COOPER.  The 2006 Mini Cooper I traded in did not have this problem of poor reception for one particular station.  But my new MINI Cooper does.
The center console makes it hard to access the recliner adjustment lever.  I did not get the center console in my new MINI because of the interference.
Button is hard to push.
Button is hard to push.
People have difficulty hearing me when I speak on phone using bluetooth.
door panel scuffs and soils easily and doesn't seem to come clean when washed.
: System randomly reboots for no reason

Display stopped working--became distorted and unable to change functions.  Dealership replaced entire entertainment system.
would like more powerful airflow when blowing cold air

can only unlock with remote key and it doesn't always work
poorly laid out
: remote key doesn't always work



Isn't intuitive

Junk : phone didn't work at all; unusable
garbage from manufacturer; arm rest broken
not smooth; very touchy
The trunk release button is very difficult to press down.
Not having the window controls on the doors is stupid.  It has been changed in the newer models but not available on the model I bought.
The door lock buttons on the exterior handles must be pushed hard to engage. Not being able to unlock the passenger door from the drivers side is stupid. These are design flaws not repair issues.
Using the settings features in this car are not easy; not intuitive & frustrating. You should be able to see the clock in the same place on any screen.  Again a design issue.
The process of choosing your favorite stations & programming them is too convoluted. This should be so easy.
In a convertible there is no seat belt height adjustment so the seat belt cuts across my neck which is very uncomfortable & annoying. There should be a belt holder on the seat so the belt is a) reachable & b) adjustable. Another design flaw. They sell an after market bracket for this but it's cheap & breaks easily.


Window controls are at bottom of front dash console. They are blocked when beverage containers are in cupholders. They also are not co-located to be operated together by one hand. They are not easy to identify without looking; which while driving requires driver to take eyes off road for several seconds and this is a safety concern.
The tack/info gauge is located on the top of steering wheel column and behind steering wheel. If the steering wheel is tilted down low for a small driver; the top of the steering wheel blocks the top of the tach and it can not be read by driver.
Dual USB / Mini Stereo audio ports are at bottom of front console in front of gear shift and cup holders. These are outdated for use with iPhones that have lightning connector and you have to buy an adapter. There is also no allotted place to rest your iPhone/smartphone once connected.
On moderate to heavy bumpy roads there is a plastic on plastic 'sticky' rattle where door of glove compartment meets dash. I think the components may just need a treatment with some plastic conditioner. This is not audible on normal smooth freeway driving.
Both seat belts retract behind their respective seats when you get out of the car;and you have to fish them out the next time you get into the car and try to fasten them.  It is a design problem that would easily be fixed with a plastic stop to catch the belt on the corner of the seat;
When engine is cold; it sometimes stalls during acceleration when starting from a dead stop.
The passenger seat belt rattles when it bumps against the side of the car; therefore; in order for me to have a quiet ride when I am driving alone; I have to hook the passenger seat belt 
It's no big deal. I figure it is because it is hot outside and I put the air conditioner on. If I put the heater on; the window clears because it becomes close to the same temp as the outside air. However; It would be awesome if the car could calculate the outside temp and when the defroster comes on; the proper temperature of heat/cooling comes on to clear it.
When using the cup holder; it is difficult to operate the window switches which are on the dashboard.
Hard to reach with the center arm rest installed.
Chrome scoop ordered for vehicle.  Installed at dealership prior to taking delivery.  Was scratched and had to be reordered/replaced again
location is behind stick shift.  Area serves as a place to put small objects but if cords are coming out of this area than you either use the cords or as a small storage area but not both.
Bought the car off of the showroom floor.  Minute scratches were from potential buyers leaning over to view inside the convertible.  Dealer immediately corrected problem.
Controls for windows; etc.; are blocked when cup is in cupholder.
Location blocks window and door lock control switches
The navigation system is poorly designed and lacking many of the regular features that other systems provide. For example it will say 'turn left' without giving street to turn on. Speed limit is not shown as in every other system we have owned. Does not understand verbal directions and instead gives directions to address not requested.   This is a poorly designed system and nothing that a dealer can fix. It is the bad software design and not a mechanical issue. So it has not been taken to a dealer to fix.  : We have stopped using the navigation system because it is not intuitive in the least.
Does not provide sufficient movement. Inadequate control for complete comfort.
Does not provide much lumbar support
Difficult to operate
very difficult to find hood release on exterior under hood
older person with shoulder arthritis; very hard to pull down hatch cover
the engine is anemic...why even have a 'roadster' if a ford focus can beat it in traffic????  Very sharp design is ruined by poor hp engine.  Its a joke.  I sacrificed the looks a little and got a nisan 370z convertible that blows it off the rad but still looks sharp!  Same price too. : not enough power or acceleration due to very low hp.  The dealer cant fix a design flaw to the engine.  I solved the problem myself by dumping the car on the open market for a loss.    i now drive a Nisan 370z convertible which has the sporty looks and the performance I wanted.
it is the engine design...the engineer should be shot!!!  The dealer re-calibrated it but it did not change anything.  a rock is a rock no matter how you dress it up.  the engine should have a hp of 300+.  Not 129 and 146!   Are you kidding me????  No wonder Consumer Reports does not consider it a 'roadster'.  It is a 'sporty car' but NOT a sports car and NOT a roadster.  sporty ONLY in looks.  But the ford focus is cheaper and sportier and I would not own it either.
See above...other comments areas...same thing.  This is an engine design problem.  It can not be fixed at the dealer. : not enough power or acceleration due to very low hp.  The dealer cant fix a design flaw to the engine.  I solved the problem myself by dumping the car on the open market for a loss.    i now drive a Nisan 370z convertible which has the sporty looks and the performance I wanted.
It's in a difficult spot and sometimes becomes unplugged.
lARGE CUPS OR CONTAINERS COVER SWITCHES FOR WINDOWS DOOR LOCKS AND GOG LIGHTS ON CONTROL PANEL

It would be ease-yer if they where on the outboard side of the seats; with the center arm rest  it is very hard to get at and operate the controls; because the space they are in is so narrow and cramped.
Was just a small door edge chip. We bought t/u paint and fixed it ourselves. It was no big deal
Water drips in from corner where convertible top and window meet when I open or close the door while raining.
Within 2 weeks of having the vehicle; the passenger side front tire exploded on the highway.  At the time of the tire damage; I did not feel any bumps; potholes; or road hazards that I might have hit.  I was able to maneuver the vehicle to the shoulder of the highway. The vehicle was towed to the dealership and a new tire was placed on the car.  I have had no other tire issues since.
The car doesn't make any noise/alert when the car locks/unlcoks. I would LOVE to have the car alert when it is locked or unlocked.
: The phone pairs with the vehicle ; without issue.  The person on the other end of the call states that the person calling sounds like they are underwater/garbled/in a tunnel. The driver can easily hear the call.

People have difficulty understanding me.
: Holding the lock button on the key does not close the converiltible top
I find it difficult to operate the seat back adjustment due to the middle console.  I have to move that out of the way in order to adjust which is not a big deal.
Run flat tires in front had bubbles after several weeks of driving.  To be fair; roads are not in the best shape following a rough winter in NE
Driver can hear caller; but caller cannot understand what driver is saying
Often locks when trying to pull seat belt in order to buckle
Sun visor is too small and driver has to shift in seat to block sunlight coming in
i DO NOT SEE A INTERIOR TRUNK LIGHT.  I DO NOT SEE AN INTERIOR TRUNK OPEN BUTTON???
: when usig the phone; the person I am calling has a very difficult time hearing me 
cup holder opening is too small for gym bottles
The part that you push in on the handle is too close to the part that is stable.  It is requires a lot of strength of your fingers to push the handle in.
The paint under the passenger door handle is a lighter color red than the rest of the car.  I noticed it the evening after the purchase.
Most folks use intermittent wipers more often than a single swipe.  I would prefer that I could move the control down and get intermittent wipers rather than pushing in on the stem.
The indicator keeps going off that the passenger airbag is not engaged; even if I put my purse on the passenger seat.  Makes me wonder if it will work if there is a passenger in the seat.
: iPhone only plays music throug drivers side front speaker no stereo
Latch is difficult to get to.

The door locks are in a counterintuitive location and the trunk lock should be managed inside the car as well.
Cup holders block controls.

: fan runs loudly sometimes after shutting off engine
: The chrome hood vent kept popping out.

When open it likes to shut by itself -- won't stay put

Narrow and hard to use
Black shows scuff marks on door near bottom





: When using the Bluetooth to talk on the phone the person on the other end says it sounds like I am in a 'wind tunnel' and it is hard to hear / understand me.

Car had to have software update and everything has been fine.
Two of the stations on my 'Favorites 8' list fade in and out sporadically.
The window moldings are all loose.
The hood doesn't line up well at the corners.
Loud; low pitched whistle when clean air is blowing over the car; IE no traffic.
: The system wiped all presets and controls; necessitating a 'reboot' of the entire car.

It's on the inboard side of the vehicle and difficult to access.
Rattle from the passenger door panel under speed; caused by vibrations in the road.
Rattle from the back hatch assembly under medium speeds; vibration based.
My stripe has bubbles - repaired tomorrow
I'm confused with the pre-sets; and navigating the radio menu and the navigation between all the features.
i have driven loaners and they get really warm. At the top adjustment; mine gets warm but not toasty. The bottom 2 aren't used at all because of that.
: Forward/backward adjustment just not easy to operate. Would have preferred electric seat adjustments. Nothing for dealer to fix
Notice specks on the hood at delivery. It was taken back to be washed off; but the specks remained. In the process of contact dealer regarding the continuing problem.
Hatch is hard to close; because when I closed it the first coupe of times; the hatch ajar light came on in the dashboard. I found that I had to stop the car; get out; open the hatch; and very firmly slam the hatch to make sure it was closed.  After a while; I got used to very firmly slamming the hatch shut to avoid the hatch ajar light. But; I am glad that during rainstorms; there are no water leaks.



: Audio/Nav system intermittently 'loses' most of the menu items; they just disappear. Often the options are not available for hours.


: Seat belts. Poor design; hard to reach.: Seat belt design poor. Hard to reach.


I expected the seats that were special ordered to be more padded/comfortable than they are.  I am a bit disappointed.  I thought seats would be more conforming to my body.  They are great looking but really hard.
The rattle was due to cargo cover coming loose after removing items that had been in the trunk.  I have to remember to ensure it is put back into place correctly which solves the rattle.
I am constantly adjusting the mirror more than in any car I have had
I have white scuffs on the black material in the car and the headrest you can't easily wipe because of all the tiny holes
Because I have shorter legs; need to have seat in a position nearer the wheel.  Entering or exiting the car; my right knee often bumps the light position control and changes the setting.  The positions should work more stiffly.
easy to open but hard to close as there is no handle to use to close it
car had minor scratch on paint but was buffed out before keys were given to me
Sometimes the trunk opens without me touching the button to open it. I close it tightly and I get in my car and I get a message on my dashboard that it is open. I have to take my car in to the dealership to get this fixed.



Tire pressure indicator can activate if sudden temperature change and must be reset which is not obvious.
There was a scratch in the windshield and I didn't notice it till I drove it in the daylight.  The dealer replaced the windshield but had my car for several days.
Activating Siri does not activate the microphone in the car; so Siri connects to the car; but cannot hear anything. From message boards I've seen; it appears to only be a problem for Mini Coopers that do not have the Visual Boost or Nav options.
hd radio skips like a cd
you get mixed-up with the other manual control for seat adjustment

controls put in a bad location

engine is loud for a new car. sounds terrible
Other Reason:  Voice has odd accent.
There is not enough range of reclining available. It is too extreme; location is terrible.
The location is odd as it is not with the reclining control. Plus; it doesn't go high or low enough.

The brakes easily shudder in what appear to be normal conditions that I have not experienced in previously owned cars.
Seat belt locks too easily; and is VERY difficult to fix. I had to drive with a nonfunctional seat belt because I couldn't fix it.
It scuffs easily even if you touch it gently with your shoes.
only one cup holder in back;need more cup holders-put in the side of the doors; please.
easily scuffs
Scratch on driver side rear view mirror
The floor Matt does not lay flat
disconnects from bluetooth often or doesn't connect at all.
Sometimes; it just won't connect to my phone_ÔøΩÔøΩ_ÔøΩÔøΩeven though bluetooth on my phone is turned on and in close range.







I cannot seem to find front windshield fan.


As the vehicle comes to a stop/park position; the doors should all automatically unlock without having to manually push the button on the driver's side door.
When you release the trunk hatch from inside; if you close the driver's side door and walk to the rear; the latch locks again.  You have to then use the remote to unlock it again. Quite frustrating

It is just very hard to find which control makes the seat recline; there are two levers very close to each other and all the passengers want to grab the other control when they are trying to make the seat recline. I now have it figured out finally.
It does not happen all the time; if my car has been parked and i go to back out of my driveway it goes into reverse very easily. Now if i have been driving and say pull into somewhere; then want to back into a parking place; when you go to put it into reverse it is very hard to change and makes a 'clunk' noise. I try to make sure my foot is pressed firmly on the brake and sometimes i wait just a few seconds before i try to put it into reverse but it still does it.
i noticed it right away and thought maybe i was doing something wrong; like not pressing down the brake pedal firmly enough when i tried to put it in reverse. It does not happen when my car has been parked for a long period of time like while I'm at work all day then go to leave and back out of my parking space its fine; but if I'm driving then try to pull in somewhere and back up it makes the 'clunk' noise and is hard to move the gearshift from park to reverse.
At first the phone would connect to the USB port and play songs; then after a couple of days it juste charges the phone and does not play any songs.
it takes a little to long for the windows to defog
: The hood is jus a few millimeters off askew. It does not line up with the side panels perfectly.
I always have to help people find it the first time. It is hidden under and obstructed by the lap part of the seat belt
You can hear it thump every time you go over a speed bump.

The hesitation is not bad; but I wish it was better/nonexistent for a car that is supposed to be a sports car.
when exiting the vehicle and locking the door it takes several button pushes before the door locks. It's not clear if there is a sequence that needs to be followed. Occasionally I will press it once; wait a few seconds and press it again so that it will lock. Passenger side locks as soon as the button is pressed.
Pervious models had the cruise control located on the right side of the vehicle. As a right handed person this was convenient. 2015 model has them on the left which is more difficult to use.
The handle that you use is put back further than expected and is obstructed by the seat belt where it connects to the car. My passengers and myself are always grabbing the seat height adjustment handle thinking it's the recline adjustment.
sounds like a fly buzzing
Does not blow enough air on to the driver.
: The auto setting on the windshield seems inconsistent. Sometimes it keeps the windshield completely rain-free and sometimes it is non-responsive.
I am uncertain still how to unlock more than just the driver side door when I am standing at the driver side door outside of the car. The key button on the door handle clicks each time I push it but I can't tell what is being unlocked. When I have a passenger; I unlock the car from the button on the outside of the passenger door because I know it will work that way.
The side visor hits the headrest when I attempt to pull it down to block sun coming in from my left. I have to recline my driver seat; extend the side visor and then reposition my seat to use the side visor. Very frustrating!
: My Mini has automatic climate control.  I would rather it be manual.  When I shut off the automatic system; a fan still turns on every time I start the car.  I will be going to the dealer to ask about this problem in 2 days.
: The front right headlamp chrome trim ring came off while driving down the interstate.  Only six plastic clips hold down the ring onto the hood of the car.  Replaced under warranty. Also; rear bumper plastic film adhesion to the bumper had air bubbles.  this was a dealer add on and was replaced by dealer's contractor at no cost to me.
locking doors is inconvenient.  pushing down on the lock button after opening the doors is not functional.  need to push the exterior black button on the door handle to lock the door.  this is unconventional..seems strange to me.

my husband and I each have smart phones and we can NOT both be connected at the same time - one of us always has to turn off the blue tooth connection.  we also have to repair/reconnect every time we are in the vehicle!
There is a large fingerprint smudge on the inner light lens.
Tire noise is quite high considering the type of tires .
Tachometer is very small with small range of motion. Fuel level is 8 LEDs so resolution is low. Need to scroll through too many menus to get to various displays such as engine temp; outside temp; economy/range; etc.
System always defaults to a previous 'on' setting. Does not remember when system is turned off when car is shut off. System seems to require manual fan speed adjustment even when set to full auto.
Car has 2 glove boxes. The upper one is small and wedge-shaped; and is difficult to latch closed. I've heard that MINI plans on eliminating it altogether.
: The COLOR of the seat/interior material was not a choice that could be accommodated with the mini-cooper convertible. I preferred beige seats and interior; one for the 'hot seat' problem of the black seats with being out in the sun and for the black showing the slightest bit of dust or pollen.   You buy a convertible because you want the top down; when the top is down; road dust;etc. fly in and deposit themselves everywhere.  Beige interior would NOT show the dirt; pollen; leaves; etc. You buy a convertible because you want the top down; when the top is down EVERY BLACK SURFACE becomes an instant 'hot seat' and 'hot wheel' with instant BURN factor. Why was BEIGE not a choice for the convertible??????? This is the only problem I have experienced with the mini-cooper and it's not even summer yet.



To lock them I have to press the button on the handle 3 - 4 times before they lock  UNLESS I unlock them all before I get out... then they will lock on first try.
: The radio has a mind of its own.  With changing no settings the screen will become different.  Yesterday it went weird and today I see the time is now off by 6 minutes.

the navigation system is hard to hear and she tells you almost too late when you need to turn or exit.  If i didn't already have an idea of where i was going; i would miss my turn/exit.
The seats were a light grey and after only about 2 weeks they have a blue tint to them and look bad.  They look like they are 10 years old and we have only had the car 3 months.  They scuff easily; for example when wearing jeans they seem to mark up the material.  I have tried cleaning them and the dirt and blue tint does not come out.
The handle to adjust the seat recline is covered up by the seatbelt. This makes it hard for passengers to locate the handle so that they can recline their seat. However; once located the seat is easy to recline.



: Rear view mirror in center of windshield does not stay adjusted.  It sags over time and needs to be re-adjusted frequently.

There is supposed to be a rain sensor. When I adjust the speed; it just doesn't seem to be dead on. I don't necessarily know that it's broken; I believe I just need to get used to this.
It is the furthest adjustment to the rear. It just seems like you shouldn't have to feel back that far to get to it.
You are supposed to be able to use the lever on the back of the seat to pull forward if having to get to the back seat. If you slide it back; it is supposed to go back to your setting. I haven't quite mastered this or done it enough times to feel comfortable doing it.
I tried to start my engine to leave a parking lot but I could not move the stick to drive; it was stuck.
deep scratch on rear chrome atop lift handle
noticed wind noise on the highway


This is an intermittent problem. Sometimes it does not automatically recognize my phone when I enter the vehicle; and when I try to pair it again; it will not work. Then; the next day ; it may work fine.

Recall on tires due to labeling issues
The plastic piece fell off that you squeeze to shift gears. I was able to reattach it.


There have been times where I turn on the switch to stop the car from shut down in traffic and an alert comes on saying 'transmission on' and I have to put the car in park and shut it on again.

Hard to find tire pressure indicator in complicated menus
Tiny time in display. Wish it could be bigger.
Light color picks up blue from jeans
For some unknown reason I cam not connect my phone via Bluetooth anymore
It's just loud if the windows are open.  I know that sounds obvious; but it is much louder than in other cars.  Can't hear radio - no matter how loud I make it - if windows are even slightly open.
comes on  - do not know why.  Back to dealers twice
A few times my foot has contacted the gas pedal when applying the brakes.
Tire had a slow leak. : Left rear tire had a slow leak.

: loud noise



Seal went bad
Bad seal on valve
Bad seal on valve.  Burned two quarts in 50 miles
Bad seal on valve
I am able to reach across my stomach with no difficulty but feel sorry for a man with a belly. The buckle is pretty far back and is not elevated on a stem...I have had to have my passenger help me with it.
After the dealership installed the window tint; the windows squeak when opening and shutting.  The drivers side window doesn't seem to be closing all the way.  You can head wind coming into the car while driving when the window is shut.
: The drivers side seat belt often twists and becomes stuck when retracting.  There have been several times when I have had to drive with the seat belt extremely loose because it has twisted and gotten stuck; not pulling tight across the chest.
When I drive on the interstate at 75mph I keep checking my windows thinking they're open.
The airbag light stays on at the passenger side of the vehicle when a passenger is not in the seat.??? Questioned the dealer and they said when a passenger sits in the seat it should go out.   Haven't been able to determine this yet!!!!
My 04 Mini was simple stupid.  So sorry I gave it to my nephew.  Would like to give him the new one and I will take my old one back.  As far as I'm concerned; the most important controls and symbols in the car; are the engine; flat tire; gas gauge oil leak; etc.  Not the cup holder not the radio; not the gps not the rpm gaugeNow they are all jammed into a little gauge along with the RPM gauge; while the BIG dial in the center of the car holds a radio???Since I do not need a gpsAgain; the MIni WAS as no frills car.  You have turned it into something else.  Too puffy;looks like it was on steroids. I loved the Mini Cooper.  I no longer LOVE my mini Cooper.  I don't smile when I look at it like I used to.  Sad. Too many changes; but not for the good.  Sorry
Please look at my prior answers and comments. I am not satisfied with almost all of the gauges; instruments; etc.  I do not want to go to a CD or go on line to see a solution for questions I have about my immediate problem ie-one day my engine/temp appeared on my LITTLE PANEL????Had to call the dealer while I was driving. He said as soon as it reached temp. it will go out.  I did not.  The svc dept told me I have to press a button at the end of the turn signal??Again; too sophisticated.. I need simple stupid.  Language I can understand.
It is not normal to start a car with a button. If you're driving for 50 yrs. and you put a key in the ignition; it almost seems bizarre to push a button.  Secondly; when you shut ignition with the button; you have to make sure you do it twice?????Stupid system
The problem is trying to move the back of the seat forward.First; could not find the handle to move it and secondly; you must use your left hand to lift the lever because when I exit the car; I slide my seat back for easy exit and there is no room between the seat and the door. Left wrist has a screw in it making it difficult to work it.
Almost each time I enter the car; especially in tight parking areas; I kick the door or the door plate leaving whatever is on my shoes-dust;water; etc.
It is a scratch; the dealer stated they would fix it and would get in touch with us. To date; they have not made any effort to contact us. Nor fix the scratch.
tires are recalled for incorrect labelling


I am not very tech savvy and using the computer system to reset the time makes me have to try and remember. It is not the cars fault that I am lame. Fortunately; my dealer is amazing and I can go in and they will do it for me!!!!! I will undoubtedly be there in three weeks.  LOL
: Small paint defect along front fender seam -- white paint did not cover along edge. Yellow showing.
There seems to be a control for intermittent wipers; but I can't get it to work. To be fair; haven't consulted the manual yet.
Seat belt locks up periodically. Maybe once per month.

The removable mat keeps coming up
weird smell when I turn the car on
chip where indicated. would have thought paint was able to withstand winter.


the pre-sets are a horror! very difficult to understand. and they change! awful pre-sets
When the outside temperature is below freezing; the washer sensor causes the car to believe that the washer fluid level is low; sounding a chime in the cabin and disabling the rear washer jet.
Pairing my phone took multiple attempts and several reboots of the phone. : I am unable to use the car's built-in microphone to access the voice command features of my phone and am generally unable to use the voice command features of my phone while the phone is paired with the car.  This makes getting GPS directions while driving quite dangerous.
The automatic climate system is decided inferior to that in a previous model year  of the same make that I have also owned.  I've taken to turning the system off and configuring the climate controls manually.  I feel that I've spent money for a luxury feature that does not work.
There is a white line on the roof that appeared.  Seems to be under the top coat.
Seats will scuff and soil easily.  Very strange
Briefly turns on and then turns off again.



Just difficult to get into reverse...no grinding...has to push firmly to get over. I think it is just how it works.
trip mileage indicator no longer visible all the time; scrolling through settings/info tedious and not intuitive; even changing clock time impossible without cheat sheet; info displayed at steering column difficult for shorter person to see.

Answered previously
It's as if there's a leak within the drivers door. Whenever it rains; it sounds like it's dripping inside the door itself. When the door is opened; it's very wet in the door frame...seems like that shouldn't happen. There is no option for wet conditions above.
That iphone holder is horrible

That whole area is just too small
Hard to locate controls for rear lights
There isn't a true storage console in the middle between the two front Seats. All it has is an awkward sunglasses holder that is very difficult to open. I wish there was more storage in this area
The clock and radio functions could be improved.  They are not very intuitive or easy to use.
: The controls for the radio are not intuitive or easy to use.
Paint feathering/streaking across the hood and back passenger side roof.
Organizers available through 3rd parties.  Mini has to know how useless it is and chooses not to address.  Problem since initial release as BMW sub.
The y cable provided is horrible. It does not have enough power to charge the phone and the location is not driver friendly.
Rattle noise in door panel; close to a pillar


: wire connection for phone/music a little loose
Alarm sounds for no apparent reason. Not been back to dealer to discuss it yet

It's very small.. Not much storage for stuff anywhere else in the driver area
Awkward placement.. Not much space .. Hard to get at with brake down
Smells fishy
The noise is excessive at all times. To the point where the bluetooth is hard to hear on both ends.
sound is loud which appears to be coming from the road.
at different times during the car ride; there is a creak like noise that i can not pin point. It sounds like it comes from the doors and at other times it appears to be the frame of the car?

Difficult to start a search depending on location stored and difficult to search for anything. Really only works with actual address.
: Seatbelt holder hard to reach. Have to turn around in seat in order to grab seatbelt.
It is not clear sound; not sharp enough

Everyone getting into the car needs help to open the door; squeezing a handle to get into a car is not usual.
It is better on the paceman then minicooper put water runs off into the car getting in and out during a rain storm or driving and slightly opening window.
The center panel is difficult to see the phone due to the brake in the stick ship the sunglass case was really in the way; I just took it off. The smart phone should go somewhere else on center console is difficult to use and see; and operate.
opens easily awkward positioning for handle to close have to grab painted surface to perform easily. Not a dealer issue more of a design issue. power open and shut would be a great amenity for a vehicle this highly priced in its segment.
swirl marks on entire car due to poor dealer cleaning/prep. Returned to dealer to correct for about a 50% resolution. Waxed and hand buffed myself to correct as I lost faith in the dealer to properly resolve.
no road hazard insurance for the tires only was available at the dealer. only overpriced insurance for wheels and tires. Had to purchase road hazard from Firetone.

: The chrome around the passenger side headlight blew off while I was driving 75 mph on interstate and got caught on passenger outside mirror
Was too large and kept going over gas pedal.  Improper installation at dealership
aux input is faulty and cuts in and out. When it isn't functioning properly only half of the speakers put out sound. Mini has already scheduled to replace this at no cost under warranty at my next service or sooner if I'd like to leave my car and pick up a loaner.
Most likely caused by roof rack.


Outside wind noise on the driver's and passenger's side is very apparent when driving this vehicle.
Sometimes the phone does not pair automatically.  I have to cut car on and off to make it work.
Very picky regarding what variable/static bitrate MP3 file must be encoded in to play through a USB stick/thumb drive. Voice recognition is Apple-centric and doesn't function with my Android phone. When a regular USB drive is used in the port; the tray for the mobile phone gets in the way.
I must turn the bluetooth on the phone on and off a couple of times before it will pair . I have not been able to sync my contacts following the manual.
Will not charge my I-Pad.

Unable to get the intermittent wiper to engage appropriately.
The armrest sits over the USB port making it difficult in transit to remove attachments.
I have been unable to use the POI function with regards to the navigation system.

When you open the glove box things tend to fall out.




cup holders block controls to fog lamps; locks; sport mode button
The headrests do not lower sufficiently and OBSTRUCT the view of the driver. This is especially true of the headrests of the rear seats.
Its hard to line up the buttons with the menu on the screen above the buttons. Knowing when to press 'Mode' buttons etc. is confusing to me.

: The windshield wiper speeds are either off or on really fast or even faster.  No slower speeds that work in light snow/rain.

I have never seen a voice recognition system that is as bad as this one.  It is useless.  I have tired to use it multiple times to make calls; etc and the commands are always wrong.  Even when saying exactly what the system is telling you to say.

It is located between the seats below the arm rest. It is not located in a good area for usage.
Car was a loaner and it had chips in the hood.  The paint hasn't arrived yet to fix it.
I called and was told the noise would go away.
sensitive to very cold weather so it misreads as low tires

I didn't notice it for the 1st couple days; then I went down some bad roads and it started.
If you are short and have your seat closer to the steering wheel; the arm rest is behind you.
There are two tiny slots; the upper one I can fit my work badge in and nothing else. The bottom one is good for my sunglasses; but very difficult to use because the cup holders block it.
Nail in tire day after purchase.

: My bluetooth radio and MP3 don't work.

Head rest can not be adjusted
The main port to connect to a phone is under the emergency hand brake. Can't see it unless the brake lever is pulled up.
the pull tabs are rather small and there are three of them; one on each seat section and the middle section. The seat moves in small increments and stops too easily going down and going up. Takes more effort than it should.
It's at an odd angle and everyone has an issue with getting the buckle into the unit. It may be too far back as it seems my arm is bent at an odd angle trying to get it in. There is no problem with releasing it.
: The exterior temperature no longer is displayed and I cannot figure out how to have it showing.
The time does not always show. I believe it is just how the MINI software is set up.

I bought a 2015 Countryman in January. I bought it because I moved to a new city and I needed Navigation to get around. It has been incorrect more often than not. This is very frustrating as it will cost $200 to update the software when a new version becomes available; yet the car is not old. It's only a few months old.
I don't know why its an issue in all Mini's  but the dealer said to use the AC when this happens.
really too small
Hissing sound from moon roof or roof rack.
Warning light came on and returned car to dealer.  They replaced a brake system component that corrected the problem
: About a quarter of the time; the radio presets do not initialize properly and a different set of presets show up from the ones that show up the other three quarters of the time.
Difficult to lower rear seats with headrests in place.
The retainer that holds the buckle at a certain height when not being used and retracted slips easily.  As it moves down; the buckle moves down behind the seat and is difficult to access as it gets caught between the seat and the door.
: Engine hesitates more that expected when starting from a stop in normal drive mode.
Minor issue; but the button on the shifter that needs to be pushed to engage reverse or park can pinch the ends of the driver's fingers.
Out of fairness; I have only tried to use on a few occasions.  It rarely understands any of my commands.
: Windshield wiper on passengers side had to be readjusted. The fluid shot up over the roof of the vehicle and the inner one wouldn't squirt out.
If wear boot I have problems

Can't compete with my smartphone. Waste of money
Rail storage is a waste
In many situations; there is no clock displayed.
Integration with iPhone is not very good. Can't control device well; no playlists; etc.
Its a good idea that the latch is the logo/emblem but seems a little cumbersome to manage if your hands are full-wish we had the power open option for the back on our key fob to not have to fumble trying to open the back door manually.
Our driveway is steep we notice it when braking and reversing out of our garage and backing down the driveway
Passenger side wiper blade flew off we picked it up and tried to put it back on but it wasnt clearing the windshield good
the run flat tires are super sensitive and damage very easily. It's disappointing and I wish I was NOT convinced to skip the tire insurance. It has been costly so far; especially in my time!
: I just dont find the audio and phone as user friendly as previous cars I've owned. The phone dialing is impossible.
: Not the best sound quality
Connection is not tight enough and in a very poor location.


air bubbles in dealer installed tinting
black soot on tailpipe
I find that the time doesn't always display on the nav/media system. I should be able to see the time at all times when the car is on. There shouldn't be buttons I need to press to get the time either on the dashboard or the nav system.
I find the voice recognition system to be very difficult to use. I thought it would be much easier. I use my iPhone for voice controls of calls and my music functions in it.
I find the navigation to be really challenging to enter addresses in to. I thought; from the salesman; it was going to be a lot like Google maps. I now only use my iPhone for navigation and ignore the Mini's navigation. I wish I hadn't purchased it.
Brakes were noisey after the first time it was returned from the dealer for the problem with the navigation system.  It was reported so it could be fixed during the second visit to the dealer for the navigation system problem.  They remained noisey and we are scheduled to return the car to the dealer for the third attempt to fix the navigation system problem.  Maybe brake noise will be fixed then.
: Navigation / Radio cuts out and resets intermittently without warning mainly during extreme cold or wet wet weather conditions.
It does not have a primary phone designation; so it will pair with other paired devices when they are in the car rather than the driver's. It also has problems properly recognizing the audio playlists.
: This seems almost bizarre to complain about; given how cold it was this winter; but the heated seats get too hot. The lowest setting should be the highest; the highest setting is far too hot for comfort.
The heat/AC controls just don't make a lot of sense. You can set the temp to a cool level; but not realize you also have to hit the small AC button. The defrost function isn't intuitive either.
i honestly can't figure out where the rattles come from. I keep trying; and moving things from storage sections; and still get the rattling.
just frustratingly small. There's very little storage in the front of the car.

The engine just seems to run very loudly; it's a constant loud rumbling that I hear most when I'm idling; though I'm still aware of it when driving.
Came on on a frigid day ; so I was afraid to go anywhere. Mechanic tried to look up the code he found; but couldn't find any info. And the dealer refused to tell me what the code meant; saying I had to bring the car in. 
may not be excessive - but it interferes with hearing the radio
not sure why - maybe set up that way - every time I push auto for temp control - the a/c indicates it is on
The usb outlet in the center console is in a poor location that isn't easy to access.
Under parking brake in center console; and when phone plugged in has noowhere for phone to rest.
not enough commands to be useful ' from phone book to dial someone.
Passenger seat weight detector is so sensitive that I can't even place a cell phone on the seat with out the seatbelt alarm going off.
Cup holders in front are under display panel; so most cups don't fit under.  THere is a change holder under center displays that is useless to access also.


Some address can't find or lead to a wrong place
no intuitive when shifting in bad weather - maybe user issue. Confused when increasing/decreasing which direction to move gearshift
The connectivity of the iPhone 6 iTunes playback is lost from time to time and needs to be reconnected.
I have talked to the MINI salesman about the road noise and was told that this car does have more road noise than most cars.  I think I'm just not used to this noisy of a car.
I'm not specifically annoyed as I expect this with these technologies. But when it works; it's delightful.


I wear big steel toe boots to work and the pedals are VERY CLOSE together
Hard to understand proper setting for the lights.  It has an auto setting that seems backwards from the normal settings.
I am a tall person and the mirror does not adjust up far enough for me to have GREAT vision
Both speed displays are a lot different than most cars making them hard to get use to monitoring your speed

RUN FLAT TIRES; HORRIBLE! WHOEVER THE GENIOUS IS THAT RECOMMENDED THEY USE THESE TIRES; DIDN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE WINTER WEATHER MARKETS THAT OWNERS MAY BE DRIVING IN. POTHOLES ARE THE NUMBER 1 ENEMY OF RUN FLATS. THIS MARKET IS NOT FOR RUN FLATS. I TOOK DELIVERY OF THE CAR DEC 23 14; I'VE CHANGED 3 TIRES ALREADY AS OF MAR 17; 15. BAD BAD BAD!
NO BLUETOOTH AUDIO CONNECTION. AGAIN; FOR A CAR OF MINI'S REPUTATION; VERY POOR TO NOT HAVE A BLUETOOTH AUDIO. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE LOCATION OF THE USB AND AUX INPUTS ARE HORRIBLY PLACED. THEY ARE LOCATED NEAR THE EMERGENCY BREAK. WHEN THE BREAK IS DOWN; IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CONNECT BOTH CABLES. MINI OFFERS A TWO IN ONE CABLE USB/AUX...WITHOUT IT; USING YOUR IPAD IS POINTLESS.
THEY NEED AN ARM REST THAT IS STANDARD. $850 FOR A DEALERSHIP INSTALLED ARM REST IS RIDICULOUS. MINI IS BMW OWNED; IT'S SHAMEFUL FOR THE BWM BRAND THAT THIS IS AN AFTER MARKET PRODUCT. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A SIGN OF STATUS TO OWN A MINI; BUT COME ON; PUT AN ARMREST IN THE CAR!
THIS CAR SAYS IT GETS UP TO 30MPG I BELIEVE; WELL THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT THE CASE. MORE LIKE 21MPG HIGHWAY; AND 15MPG CITY DRIVING.
The aux/USB iPhone connector is in a poor location in the center console. The iPhone needs to be plugged in to access the MINI Connect system because the app doesnt support bluetooth. Using Spotify ; Waze etc can be challenging to navigate while driving. Yes; I use Waze even though I have nav built in :)
A headlight went out and a module had to be replaced.
: The AUX port was broken and had to be replaced.
if you put something in the rear cargo area that is tall it pushes up on the cover and makes it difficult to see out of the rear window.  i just removed it totally and do not use it
they are not made for the snowy northeast! They stained easily with salt and snow but when I went to the Mini dealer to complain they gave me rubber floor mats that are excellent!! These type should be installed in all Mini's sold in the Northest winters!
not cooling properly
Fan / blower will not shut off at times. AC not cooling properly.
does not cool properly : Fan not shutting off not cooling properly



: Sun visors are small and relatively inefficient in blocking sun light.
Car is noisy on acceleration; especially when at higher RPM
The area that holds your cell phone device is directly underneath the handbrake.
Non-standard operation - still haven't figured out how to switch it to intermittent.
Side sensors activate when I'm backing out of the garage when I get close to the door frame.  I also exit my garage door on an angle; so the sensor sounds for most of the time that I am exiting the garage.
Does not fit taller/larger bottles





Must wipe down with solution to get rid of scuffs


Leather is hard to clean and there are too many cracks for stuff to get caught in. I'm always cleaning the seats.
Poor placement in center consol


: The Gear Shift Parking Indicator light  stays lit up in red even after the car is turned off.

: The navigation system is awful.  The voice commands don't even tell you which street to turn on.  The display shows when to turn at the wrong time.  It's like a DOS version of a computer - old and sad.
It sounds like there is something loose inside the door panel.
It makes a light rattling noise when going over bumps.
Because of the small area it would be better to have it a rod shape and not take up room with the handle shape.  It's hard to maneuver since I have other things in that area.
I have to hit it just in the right spot to make it work.
The speedometer is so huge and the radio display sooooo small.  Would be great if the display was much bigger.
I'm still not sure where it is and would have to use the manual if I wanted to adjust.
Of course I'm used to it now; but in the beginning it seemed an awkward 'pumping' up and down; and ultimately wasn't as low as I would have liked.
I do find it a bit difficult to engage the reverse gear--kind of have to hit it over to the left far enough to hit the right spot.
ergonomics of the handbrake lever is not ideal; you need to twist your arm at an awkward angle to pull the lever up. The armrest is partly in the way of the motion of your hand and arm.
user interface of the system difficult to understand; confusing to manage pairing of multiple bluetooth devices
can't seem to have nav system default to address input; the most common usage for me. I have to scroll to activate the address input option everytime. While providing directions; I've experienced incidents where the system was instructing me to go in obvious roundabout routes for no apparent reasons. There wasn't any apparent traffic issues.
headrest obstructs the view out the rear window; both in the rearview mirror and with head turned towards the back




I purchased a $100 USB/iPOD adapter from BMW/Min and aux jack does not stay plugged in and results in music only playing out of one side of the car.
I am not sure if this is just a feature I do not have; but I had thought that holding down the tailgate button would open the tailgate . It unlocks it just fine; but does not open it.
Not enought ports. Also; if I am using the USB; it will not let me continue to use bluetooth.
It is a difficult process to get connected to my phone. It does not automatically connect to my phone and I need to re-connect each time I enter the car.
Height also adjusts the tilt of the seat. I wish it would only adjust the height instead of also adjusting the tilt forward/back.
Low setting is too dim to see well.  The brights are bright enough

Glasses holder and cell phone holder in center console difficult to reach and impossible to open
The vehicle has higher than expected wind noise at highway speeds only. Probably just a byproduct of the vehicle exterior design .

Not intuitive how to remove the headrests...
at just above 50mph the sunroof makes additional noise.
seems like a long time to stop for such a little car.
frequently rubbing the foot rest when changing gear; frequently hitting gas and brake when stopping.
push button convenience package buttons don't function well.
fuel gauge is completely nonsensical
: volume control is poor when using Bluetooth.
Defroster does not work on the rear side windows.
it's tiny and the books for the car practically fill it.
no space; no privacy
size of the cup holder.  not deep enough; or wide enough.


: Temperature setting jump in 2-F increments.  The difference between 68-F and 70-F can be significant.
: Temperature setting jump in 2-F increments.  The difference between 68-F and 70-F can be significant.
Flip up center console is not easily lifted.  Change console is hard to access over drink holders.

It is not so much that the door itself is hard to open; but the handle itself can be difficult to use pushing the button for young children and handicapped individuals. Also it is frustrating that when you open the doors they do not stay open unless they are opened and held in a certain way; otherwise they swing back at you when you are trying to exit car.
I often get confused on how to get the wipers to increase or decrease their frequency.  I am learning though so it is not much of a problem.
I called the dealership to get help with getting the doors to all unlock or lock when entering and exiting the car.  The problem is resolved.  It is difficult to set up though.
Of all the problems with the car this is by far the biggest one.  The location of the side view mirrors are horrible and very small.  It does not give you a very clear view of your side views.  The passenger side mirror is located in a terrible position.  It is too low and part of the view of the mirror is obstructed by the door that it is attached to.
The control stick to the left of the steering wheel is difficult to manipulate and learn to use...
I have tried buying several aux cords to plug into the aux recepticle.  They all have a problem working.  I have to wiggle the cord in just the right way to be able to hear sound out of all the speakers.



the visor is too small to the point it does not shade the sun
no comment
rear seat control operates in two tiered system - i would like a single fluid motion :-)


the design area is compact - although there is an arm rest it is a bit narrow and does not extend out enough - I am short and when the seat is pulled forward only the elbow portion of forearm can rest
The problem has now been resolved.  We had fueled the car at a small no name gas sation and it resulted poor quality gasoline - the care was towed to dealership and repaired.
since the previous issue shared it continues to have difficulty with timing.

Improper inflation; computer light kept coming on; dealer reset the light.

the location is brilliant however when trying to connect an ipod; it can be challenging. I would have preferred the connections to be at the back of the center console with the ipod in front of you for changing ipods or iphones . : My device port has connectivity issues; I have had the cord replaced however we now suspect it is the actual AUX port. When playing an ipod; the cord is unable to pick up left side speakers as well as doesn't now stay connected.
I believe it has to do more with the windows and design however when driving with the rear windows down; even slightly; the vehicle sounds like a helicopter in flight. Very choppy noise.
Seems to be noise in and around drivers door when riding on slightly bumpy roads
Gas tank lid cover I broken. Will not lock.
Initially did not recognize me but have never taken the time to do a detailed study.

It seems like engine often runs after it has been shut off. It will finally shut down but usually once I exit car.
ergonomically incorrect








buttons too small and hard to read difficult to reach while driving
my hands seem to be too large for controls
Engine runs at what seems like a high RPM.
I feel like I'm going to break the opening latch on the door because the force required to open the back door is so great.
: When folding the back seat row down I quickly discovered that I need to keep my head well out of the way because as soon as the latch is pulled the seats jerk forward quickly and I've been hit in the face a few times.  It makes it difficult to stay out of the way because to reach the pull cords to release the seats so they will fold forward you need to lean over the seats.

I use a 44oz Styrofoam cup most days and it's very difficult to get it to fit in the front cup holders.  If I'm not careful I turn on the seat warmers.  It's even more difficult to remove them from the holders.  I generally have to use both hands to extract the cup.

Will play music when on the phone streaming via bluetooth
When i place my are on the arm rest it is squeaky.
The dealer told me that the windshield wipers would automatically sense the rain but this is not the case

The mini connected is terrible. You have to go through a series of steps every time you get in the car just to play music. Too much trouble so I end up listening to CD's or the radio which is awful!I can't figure out the 'office' part at all. I was told it did all kinds of things that I can't get to work at all.
The mini connected is a waste of money; I wish I never paid for this feature. Not at all user friendly
it doesn't recognize devices and wont allow play mode.
It is noticeable when im at a stop and slips when I push the accelerator.
it hesitates when at a stop in drive.  Only in regular not sport mode
number display to small or not bright enough. some of us have difficulty see in yellowish tones for the display. i believe bright white or bold black with slight contrast would help. ex time;temperature; gas milage; speed etc..


will take to dealer
Handbrake takes up much of the center console space and blocks my view of my phone which sits in phone holder and connects to auxiliary port.
: Airbag warning came on when I put an item weighing about 5 pounds on passenger seat. Continued to sound for the first few minutes of each driving session for about ten trips; then stopped sounding.
Port is in console wher I have a phone holder. It is difficult to plug in the phone cord and it comes loose often.
The problems are self explanatory and are hard to see!!!!
It's just ok; hard to use and I'm disappointed I didn't understand these control when I bought the car because if I had been better informed I would of wanted a car with mini connect and mini connect should be standard in all MINIs
USB port and Aux located in a terrible spot and hard to access because of the position. Also the cords interfere with the emergency break
Hard to explain why but seems like nothing fits except the owners manual
Not a big deal but hard to open; reach and nothing hardly fits because it's too shallow
Anything that rubs against the panel leaves a mark
It's the front one where I charge a cell phone.  It will charge; but EXTREMELY SLOW.   Any other car charges 100 % faster.  And I know for sure it is NOT the cable as I've replaced it; & use the cable in other cars without any issues.
It's small and awkward & gets in the way of the center console area.
: Engine light came on.  Book said OK to drive but take in as soon as possible.  Was due to gas tank lid not being tight enough after refueling.  Dealership said no way to reset without bring car in.  Took over  2 hr. to get fixed.  Were promised at time of sale we would be provided a loaner car.... outright lie.  Disappointed!
: I can not connect my iPhone 6 to my vehicle to experience mini connect
voice dialing does not work
: The car acceleration is poor and drags 
I get 15 MPG in CIty



When car is wet  if the windows are open in front - the water beads inside of the car instead of routing another way.  Design just doesn't seem good here.  The backseat  window leaked when i went through a car wash.  Window was fully closed it seems like there may be an issue with the rubber stripping which allowed the water to come inside.
Most noteable when multiple people in car.  I've only had the car in colder months so far so i've noticed it with Foggy / damp / rainy weather most.
: I noticed that in the colder months it would seem like there was a cold  air flow hitting my legs while driving.  I tried to adjust the settings and circulation  to adjust but it did not seem to help.
Mini did not offer the option of xenon headlamps on the standard countryman. only on the turbo; which I did not want. So I had to settle for the standard headlamps which by comparison are not bright enough.
the location of the parking brake is poorly located; it takes up valuable space in the middle which could be used to stash items if not for the parking brake lever.
: the stereo system does not get loud enough. And; they only offered the upgrade to a harmon kardon stereo system if I bought a  turbo countryman. So; my only option for a standard countryman was the standard stereo; and it only gets to a certain volume.

In a tight location.
It barely fits anything in it but the book that comes with the car
There is no center console storage which is very inconvient
Hood doesn't have a cover underneath to prevent heat from entering vehicle. It gets very HOT

: i find it to be slow in acceleration.
I buy a large tea at McDonalds every day and they are a very tight squeeze in the cup holds and I have to pry the cup out and the lid pops off and spills sometimes!!!
The seat belt once unbuckled; does not retract the way it should; unless you pull it back and forth over and over. Even then it doesn't snap back fully; I have to put it behind the seat to close the door.



passenger side mirror doesn't have the best view for safety



When manually opening the trunk it sticks quite badly at times.  A significant amount of force is often needed to get it open.
The AUX jack has not worked properly since the vehicle was delivered.  It works intermittently.

Not deep enoughI can put things in but when I reach over to open it they fall out.


: The automatic wiper is annoying;they unnecessarily  come on and run more than I would like.
within a week of taking ownership; an error message claiming the driver airbag was not working appeared. The dealership replaced it under warranty.

The shape of the handbrake handle takes up a lot of room and is partly hiden under the console.  Additionally; the release lever is difficult to opperate
only the driver can see information like the temperature; while the entire car can see the speed they are going.  The clock is small and hard to read and may not display depending on the selected screen

The controls are located too low on the dash require the driver to look down to find them.  They lake clear and simple operation. For example; changing where the air comes out might take pushing 2 or 3 buttons as oppossed to simply turning a single dial.
its just seems under-powered for the car.
This is a worthless storage areas--its tiny to begin with; but MINI had in minde that people would buy a cradle for their phone to use the worthless MINI connect feature.
Its cramed agains the toggle switches and HVAC controls
The sun visor leaves gaps on either side allowing the sun to blind the driver.


Right side-view mirror is low for my line of sight. The view is obstructed by the window frame.


Not intuitive.
Passenger side doesn't consistently unlock easily.

See previous explanation.
Clock is not easily read on the Paceman. Had a loaner Countryman and the clock was larger; illuminated and digital.

The seat back control isn't accessible with the console in the way.
Material doesn't breathe in hot weather so uncomfortable. Also hard to clean the leatherette.
Explained in answers above.
Slide forward onto gas pedal. Nothing holding either side in place.
The configuration of the wipers is just different than other cars - I wasn't used to this type of setup
The light is always on indicating the airbag is off until someone sits in the seat.  Just seems odd that the warning light is always on
: My horn was going off by itself - for an entire 1 hour drive. I could only stop it by pressing the horn
: I have asked the dealer about this. When I press the recycle button to keep the air internal it only stays active for about 3 mins. I then must press it again.
The Foot well in general is smaller than anyone with a size 12 shoe would want
The Connector is for an I-phone4 rather than the new 5/6 connector which is what everyone has now
: Windshield wiper speed control is terrible


Too small; what a waste of space.
Front cup holders practically placed on the floor; too far from the steering wheel and too difficult to drink safely.
Turn signals have two positions - momentary and on.  Manually cancelling the 'on' position requires moving the stalk in the same direction as engaging - an unnatural way to cancel signals .  I'm getting used to it; but there is no good reason why they designed it this way; and for new drivers; it presents a safety issue.
Indicator appeared recently.  Have not yet notified the dealer.
the driver side and front passenger seat belts do not adjust up and down; and uncomfortable cross the neck due to my height.
clock is so tiny
just confusing and difficult to navigate and set up bluetooth connectibility

larger styrofoam cups tend to stick; and not much clearance
Controls hard to reach
Seems to be a rattle not sure where it comes from
When I hit a bump the steering wheel jerks nearly out of my hands. I need to keep both hands firmly on the wheel at all times.
I have tried to reset the time several times. No; I have not read the instructions yet. I thought a simple task would be easy enough to figure out. Every time I think I have it; I hit something that takes me back out of settings. Confusing controls.
I have to reach back too far while driving. It makes me have to look down and between seats while driving.
It does not happen daily; but at times when I go to accelerate or decrease speed from a low rate of speed the car jerks a bit.
It is difficult to reach the knob that adjusts lumbar support. It is placed too close to the middle storage console


The lighting system seems dim to me. does not light the road way enough for night driving.
When I make sharp turns; the car creeks like there the parts are giving.
: Sometimes; the bluetooth won't shut off even though I'm not using the phone.  The radio will stop playing.
: Sometimes; the bluetooth won't shut off even though I'm not using the phone.  The radio will stop playing.
I'm not sure if the engine is supposed to sound like it does; but it is louder than I feel is should be.
The headrest seems to be tilted forward more than the backrest. I'm fairly short so i have it lowered all the way down and raising it all the way up is no better. so it kinda of feels like my head is slightly being muster forward. It is more noticeable if I have my hair pulled back.
Unable to set radio stations.  Manual instructions were very poor to understand.
To hard to switch back and forth
Cannot retract the seat belt
About two weeks after delivery; we noticed two dings on the driver's side hood when washing the car in bright outdoor light.  No paint damage - just indentation dings. They are easy to see in the right light but we're missed them when purchasing. We intend to ask the dealer to fix these with paintless dent removal.
I cannot find a light in the cargo area. There must be one; right??

This noise is a weird vibration noise that appears at certain speeds and sometimes during idling.
With a common coffee travel container ; the container hits the toggle controls and this tilts the cup away from the console so that it is not fully upright. Weird design and location. If the holder was back 1' this would not happen.
Back seats cannot have their headrest removed to create a better folded position.
The door appears slightly open or ajar. The closure is not a tight fit.
When compartment is closed nearly impossible to open. I simply leave the eyeglass holder open at all times.
Holds soil even after vacuuming the vehicle



: I cannot increase the volume on the freeway. It has a limit on the volume that will not let it go louder and I can hear some wind noise which i usually get rid of by increasing the volume.

it keeps being turned on at many times.
passenger door accent light not properly installed. Noticed a few days after delivery. Easily fixed.
Slight fading/discoloring of the drivers side mirror; very top and not the paint but material between the paint and the mirror. Passenger front side on the chrome lining of the window there is a permanent water-like strain/streak.
: While using my Bluetooth system; about 80% of the time the person on the other end of the call says that they are having a hard time hearing me; my voice is crackling. I have Verizon; I don't have problems with my Iphone 5 when using it without my Mini Bluetooth feature.
The clock is very tiny and can not be seen from the drivers vantage point
the cup holder is to far forward and to low to the floor

The chrome details around the window had signs of uneven colour resembling rust.
: Interference. Intermittent hiss during very infrequent occasions. I am unsure if it is a problem with new Phone or speakers.

Type of tires/wheels lead to the noise.  Just a fact of life owning a Mini...nobody ever seems to mention to anyone and I've heard folks complain about it.  I don't have an issue with the noise; I expected it based on driving a roadster type vehicle.

TOO COMPLICATED; DOESN'T EVER RECOGNIZE MY VOICE; HAVE GIVEN UP ON IT
I HAVE NO ISSUE RECEIVING OR SENDING CALLS; BUT I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE ISSUES SINCE DELIVERY TRYING TO USE THE BLUETOOTH FOR MUSIC ON MY PHONE. WHENEVER I TRY TO USE IT FOR MUSIC; IT CAN'T SEEM TO CONNECT. I WANTED THE BLUETOOTH SO I WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO MUSIC ON MY PHONE AND/OR IPOD. IT DOESN'T WORK.
DIFFICULT FOR PASSENGERS TO ADJUST SEAT BASED ON POOR LOCATION; DIFFICULTLY MOVING SEAT
THIS IS A USELESS FEATURE
IT'S CONSTANTLY DIRTY
VANITY MIRROR IS USELESS. EASIER TO USE REARVIEW MIRROR THAN VANITY MIRROR. VISOR IS USELESS AS WELL. WAY TOO SMALL & ODD SHAPED.
: SCRATCHED WINDSHIELD
TAKES A LOT TO GET THE CAR MOVING FROM A STOP; OFTEN FEEL LIKE I'M STOMPING ON GAS TO GET IT TO GO. POOR ACCELERATION; SHIFTING IS SUDDEN; LOUD & ROUGH.


There just hard to use; I don't know if it's because it's new
When I want to recline the seats it's hard to adjust and when I want to move the driver seat or passenger seats back or forth it's hard to adjust as well


Design flaw.
Two blow outs at 3600 miles and again at 4100miles.  Both caused by hitting chuckholes.  One on I 26 north of Columbia S.C. and the second on I 70 west of Columbus Ohio. First resulted in a tow to Mini dealer in Greenville S.C. 77 mile tow.  Had to have front realigned and was charged for the new tire even though had road hazard free replacement.  Their charge was $480 and we have not been reimbursed after request.  Pirelli said all Mini dealers are aware of the  warranty.  I beleive I have been defrauded.  The second blowout in Ohio resulted in a tow to Mid Western Mini and loss of car from Saturday until Tuesday.  They had no 19 inch tires in stock.  The service writer first told me I had no warranty as I had not bought the extended road hazard insurance. N8m I told her I had talked to Pirelli and that there was a year free replacment.  She said nothing further and when I picked up the car; I was not charged for the new tire just another 4 wheel alignment in less than one week.
There is a lot of wind noise with the sun roof open; I've had several cars with sun roofs and this one seems the nosiest.
: Not really a 'problem' more of a design flaw.  When retracting shoulder strap there isn't enough clearance between the door/wall and the seat's back causing the buckle to jam between

Hand brake is difficult to understand. When I think the brake is all the way down; it is not. It seems as though the handbrake has 2 stop positions making it annoying when the alert signal goes off. It also interferes with the center storage area where I like to place my phone while having it connected to USB or auxillary. Doesn't leave much room
Need more lighting in trunk area! If trunk is full of cargo; light gets easily blocked making it very difficult to see anything.
Being only 5 feet tall; he headrest should come down further. I think the headrest should stop until it actually touches the seat instead of leaving a 1-2 inch gap
When trying to defog/defrost in the morning; can take up to 5 minutes to defrost windshield. Very slow compared to previous cars driven. Also one time while raining; windshield and front windows fogged up so bad  nothing worked for me except to use the AC. It took  a lot of trial and error and was on a long commute home. Poverty inconvenient and dangerous while driving
I'm only 5feet tall; main sun visor and side sun visor are useless to someone of my stature. It doesn't cover the sun for me at all. It should be much longer
CONSOLE TILTS UPWARD  INADVERTENTLY WHEN ATTEMPTING TO OPEN TOP OF STORAGE COMPARTMENT ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A DEFECT IN MANUFACTURING; IT SEEMS TO BE A DESIGN ISSUE.
Cup holder is too close to the center dash panel; and larger cups won't sit up right. If you put a cup in them; it hits the dash and sit crooked. I often use the back seat cup holders due to this...however that makes it hard to get your drink while driving.
headlines so faint I'm convinced they are not on at all.  Brights are barely enough; regular headlights useless. I plan to take it to dealer to have alignment checked but I've tried to check them myself and they seem okay.  There's a sort of shadow immediately in front of car extending out about 10 feet in front of car where there is no light on the road. The only way to tell they are on is to see if dials are lit up inside the car; because they barely shine enough when streetlights are on to see any difference on the road.
Keyless entry functions properly about 80% of the time.  I can walk away from car for 10 minutes and when I return it won't work. Other times it works flawlessly for days.
Because I bought GPS I was required to get armrest; but to connect iPhone required $250 snap-in adjustor. I complained so dealer gifted it. But it's out of date and can only sync with iPhone 5; so I have an old one there with no cellular; so cannot use MINI Connected features. Dealer provided cable to connect iPhone 6 to another port but it's in bad location in middle of rail; iPhone 6 flops around on seat or dangles near passenger leg. Whether connected via snap-in; cable; or bluetooth; connections are broken frequently for no reason ; sometimes works seamlessly for 10 or 15 times and then will disconnect every time the car is stopped.  Whether connected by cable or snap-in makes it hard to reach iPhone screen; so again I stick my phone on a $20 magnet attached to dash vent so I can ask Siri to play music or use my touchscreen. Audio system has funky buttons and joystick by parking break; NEEDS TOUCHSCREEN AND TO LAUNCH SIRI. Aux port in glove box doesn't do plybk
Needs to be touchscreen; NOT a joystick and pushbuttons under parking brake. cable connection leaves phone dangling in unsafe manner. snap-in adjustor only goes as high as iPhone 5; is expensive; needs constant adjustment . Needs to be able to launch Siri.
voice commands must follow certain structure; which I can't seem to remember. Then I'm forced to use buttons and joystick to try to find entries in phone book; very slow. Instead I keep phone on dash and press home button and tell Siri to place the call or play music.
I hate the whole dang thing. Complicated; fussy; controls inconvenient; connection is broken 4 o4 5 times a day whether it's connected by bluetooth or cable or snap-in. I have to pop out old iPhone in snap-in connector constantly; because it frequently breaks the connection when the car is stopped. Other times is will stay connected for days. can't figure out what the trigger is.
I absolutely hate the in-car entertainment system. GPS maps features are ridiculously bad and out of date . Must use dials and buttons; not touch-screen. My 8-year old Garmin GPS has a better screen; fonts; maps views; information; usability.  MINI GPS takes too long to program; voice commands are restrictive; and it will not launch Siri on my iPhone.  I later bought a $20 magnet that connects to vent and now rely solely on my iPhone for GPS and so I can press the Home button to launch Siri. Have complained to dealer.
Headrest has no range of motion; and is tilted too far forward for me; and was causing neck pain.  so I had to remove it entirely to reverse it; so now the headrest points backward at the wrong angle and may not provide sufficient protection.
Rattle is intermittent; seems unaffected by temperature or road conditions. Can disappear for days; then recur for days
It was a fuse that blew - the problem has been fixed.  Talked to dealer over the phone and they explained how to fix
: The radio/nav system frequently reboots itself after being in use for 3-4 hours.  We had a Countryman replaced for the same reason.  We have not reported it this time as the radio was replaced in the first Countryman we owned four times and the problem continued.  I am assuming this is an ongoing problem with the countryman
This occurred during the first few weeks of ownership- water was on the front right passengar floor mat.  I thought the right door was leaking; it was taken to the dealer and they found it was the sunroof seal wasn't done correctly.  Seems to be fixed just fine.
My husband has issues with the pedals being too close together.  My feet are smaller so it hasn't been an issue
The outside temperature I still don't know how to have it display- it shows when the temp is below 39.    The speedometer- though it is rather LARGE dail- that I never look at and the digital display is so small- so I have learned my RPM so know my speed.  I would rather have the large dial be my outside temperature.
The bluetooth audio shows to be paired; but it won't play my music.  The phone works. Haven't taken it to the dealer yet
The drinks fit in fine but it is difficult to pull them out with the knobs sticking out behind them also I would prefer the cup holder to the right of my instead of in front.
the hatch is very hard to close it opens to high i have to stand on my toes to grab to handle i am 5feet 2 and the problems cayses pain in my shoulder to reoccur  take it up w dealer but they have no solution

hatch opens too high i am a short person

seat belt on passenger side got stuck under seat adjustment up and down handle had to be taken in to service to disengage
there are no problems at this time just feel that i need to wipe down the areas to get rid of the scuff marks
The excessive road noise is from the condition of the roads. The noise is not loud on smooth paved roads; but when traveling on a worn road the road noise gets louder. Not to the point of being bothersome
: iPhone 6 plus not fully functional with MINI Connected software.
South Motors Mini; said that's how they all come.






: Passenger side vent selection to all three zones does not equal that of the drivers side.  Appears to be no upper zone selection but does have middle and lower.  Driver side has upper, middle and lower selection.  Also, passenger side has excessive air discharge in the glove box



: Power trunk opening feature doesn't work as designed.  BMW is aware of the defect and as of yet has no definitive solution.  If you wave your foot under the rear bumper the trunk is supposed to unlatch and open all the way.  However,NULL,1800,Yes,Not at all

It is louder than I expected it to be in this car
Can't find the name I'm saying for a street or tells me it doesn't exist.
The mirror needs to be bigger and the visor needs to be able to pull out to the side with an extending arm.

The hinges do not catch the weight of the door, so the door falls back toward the frame too easily. Door opens too wide. Hard to reach door to close it from the driver's seat when the door is fully extended.

The distance between car and object is distorted. You can see what is behind, but it is difficult  to judge the distance.

The red/blue dial interferes with set temperature; the dial must be on blue as an example for 60 degree temperature setting to work.  The dial seems completely unnecessary.
It isn't that is hard to open or close, it is awkward for my kids to climb out because there is no place for them to put their feet while trying to step out.

: My cell phone reception is not as strong in this car as in my former car  or the other 3 cars my family owns.  Have had issues where calls are dropped in areas where they shouldn't be dropped.
I don't understand anything about it. It is too complex.
Probably related to the light color of the leather but seems to get dirty very easily.
At times it does not shift smoothly, usually at lower speeds. Sometimes it will hold a year too long and then shift abruptly.
Usually happens if rolling to a stop but not completely stopped. When stepping on the accelerator, there is sometimes a lag before the car takes. Seems like all or nothing at times.
: Check Engine Sensor Light activated
Gives me incorrect arrival times and doesn't always show traffic but instead appears clear.  Sometimes takes me way out of the way and not the fastest route.  Told by dealer no one else has complained

Setting presets is almost impossible.  Finding radio stations is extremely difficult.  The menu structure/folders are difficult to access.  The combination of these things makes the audio system very difficult to use.

Outside noises are particularly loud when rear seats are down
too many options all ne one control.
Clock should be placed between speedometer and tachometer.



The sun visor isn't designed to slide back or extend.  Since I am tall and have the driver seat all the way back, the visor is useless when the sun is coming in from the side window.
When I took it to the dealer they found nothing wrong. The system tells me that the system isn't locked.....makes no sense. Eventually it starts working.
the blue tooth voice command doesn't recognize the command and asks for it repeatedly; i.e. 'entry #' , please repeat.  It will do that multiple times, ultimately shutting the phone off.
In this my second X-3, the sun visors are ridiculously small for the size of the windshield. They offer no glare protection and do not adequately cover the area either in front or on the side, when moved to the driver side window. Seriously?!  They are too small. Fix this detail which is really important.
After 10 days at another dealer,  a defective wire harness was discovered split, with exposed wiring. It was thought it occurred during assembly in Germany.




They are in a tiny space on dash that requires more  than a glance to obtain info.. I have to peer over the steering wheel for info instead of glancing at screen. The screen is quite small for the important info it provides.

The seat is starting to appear dirty after only 3 months. My jeans are rubbing off on the seat.
It feels like when applyimg the brakes the calipers take to long to start gripping the shoes. Best way to explain.
To me it just seems to close to other controls.
Maybe because the vehical is brand new and it's working out the squeeks and noises before seetling in. Another way of looking at it is when your shocks are going out and there's the spongeyness and squeeks that comes from the wear. That's the best I can expain.
The whole dashboard control lights lite up. The brake system lite up and said to take vehical to nearest BMW dealer asap. .

Recently took a road trip to Savannah GA.  I use the GPS extensively.  My previous cars had GPS that required the destination to be manually set.  When I tried the verbal commands, the results were very humorous -- we never did get the location right.  We were entertained for a few miles. we even tried a German accent, but it didn't work either.
My wife & I both have Verizon wireless.  Connecting both phones is a problem.
Seats
I am a short person & the highest adjustment for the seat is not high enough for me. In addition, although the upholstery is very durable & attractive, the seat is bottom is too hard. I had to purchase a seat cushion to increase the height & comfort.


: Rear view camera stopped working. Car is in winter storage and the problem will be addressed once it comes out of storage


Door panel material on driver's side is already fading due to sun exposure after only 2 months
: Occasionally I notice that my gas door is open even though I'm not opening it. This happens randomly.
I speak address and the system doesn't recognize my words and when I enter the address manually, it doesn't find the address.
Sometimes when my phone is paired, it will drop connectivity. Then I have to manually pair my phone to the vehicle .
The location of the cup holders is too close to the radio control knobs/control panel.  Because it is so close, I sometimes have difficulty inserting and removing the containers in the cup holders.
: drivers side window squeaked when closed all the way.  did not happen all the time
There is a noticeable gap between the left passenger rear door and the main body panel.
You can't easily access the USB connection without looking closely into the console.  In the dark it is nearly impossible.
The nav system often has trouble interpreting my voice commands.  It could be user error

The automatic light delay feature does not always turn off after delay setting. Light remain on. We mentioned this to dealer but not able to verify a pattern to discover the reason.

The action response to the action to open the hatch is very inconsistent.

Twice the system has taken me into dangerous areas when the traditional route I go was clear.

Steering wheel was pulling to the right immediately upon delivery of car.  Brought it back to dealership and they confirmed the steering column was not aligned correctly.  They couldn't fix it right away because US specs on how to fix it were still not in.  It is now fixed and working properly

White leather seats absorb colors from jeans and clothes.
In less than a week the seats began to show the color of the pants I had worn.  Blue/Black.  I brought it to the attention of the dealer. Their solution was to charge me about $1000 for them to treat the seats.  I just spent $125,000 for the car ! !  The seats should have been treated at the factory.  My son bought a Lincoln MKX and had the same problem.  When my son took the problem to the dealer they applied the treatment to the front seats at NO charge.  Great customer Service.   BMW 7 Series owners receive an annual Spa service.  Sort of like super detailing the car as if they were going to sell it.  This may be their response to customer service.  But during the year, your seats can look like crap.  I will have my car wash service clean the seats from time to time or do it myself.
The way the cup holder was constructed is not flexible enough to easily push your insulated glass into the holder.  I understand it is a fine line to being secure enough to hold the container from falling or tilting and being easy to use.  Owners may have to change the style of cup/glass/bottle.

Same as last comment
It always misinterprets the name of the person I want to call.  It doesn't even come close. Very frustrating.  The navigation system cannot recognize the simplest commands. The voice recognition system hardly ever interprets my commands correctly. I am trying to place a call and it takes me to the navigation system. The sales rep told me the 2016 model was vastly improved over the 2013 model but I have not found that to be true.  It is not worth the money. The system in the Toyota are far superior for half the money.
I tell the system to pull up an address of a hotel or restaurant and it can't do that. It is awkward to enter addresses and often I have to start over.  I DO like the way I can write the numbers and letters on the dial. That saves the day.
It sounds like the cover for the stereo is rattling. It just started a week ago. So I haven't had the chance to get to the dealer yet

The three blink option versus the full blink option makes it difficult to turn them on/off.  Often times you end up in a ping pong  trying to shut them off.
Does not seem to remember position consistently.

Brakes sound as if they are rubbing on something, MOST noticeable when going to leave in the morning.  I've been told this is normal.
: Windshield Wipers:  When temperatures are at the freezing mark  or below windshield wipers can not keep up or clean the windshield making it very hard to see.  Streaky when using the windshield wipers on a norm.  Windshield wipers should be a little higher in quality as should the automatic feature.


: difficulty paring at times
Same comment as before
The manual said it is an engine problem and could damage the catalytic converter



the warning system works for the side of the car but does not warn of curbs underneath as in parking lots  because the vehicle is so low it is impossible for it to ride above the curb stones and hence easy to hit the marker before the warning system picks up on it
rear seat head rests obstructs visibility-and look odd when the top is down--on the convertible  also the wind screen openings are very large and not attractive when the screen is not being used which is much of the time  the back seat belts vibrate in the wind unless they are tucked behind the seat backs
light beige picks up dirt/dust off your clothing I am constantly using leather cleaner on the seats
I don t use this feature because the transition is not smooth  so I turn off the ECO mode --switch to Sport Mode or other

: I have two BMW vehicles. Each have the Harman Kardon audio and each cost $850 extra. The audio in my 2015 535D is superior in the audio features offered. Specifically the 'Logic 7' sound system advertised and promised on both models but not found on my M235. BMW has so far been unable to address this omission and explain why they charge the same price and advertise the including of the 'logic 7' but fail to provide it. This was advertised as part of the $850 Harmon Kardon option but has been removed. Plus the M235 uses 'Active Sound' to add fake exhaust sounds through the Harmon Kardon speakers. Why buy a premium sound system and then have fake exhaust sounds overpowering the music? I have repeatedly asked how to defeat this electronic sound and BMW has so far been unable to provide an answer.

I was actually told at a dealer that the head rests of both seats are not adjustable. The angle  is odd, the head rests push the head too much toward the front and down. This is entirely not-ergonomic and causes me neck pain very quickly. The car seats of the Lexus RC coupe btw don't have this problem. Anyway I had to get an after-market bolster to prop forward my back so as not to let the head rest push my head forward/down.
The storage is not exactly between the two seats, but at the back as if you're accessing the ski pass through. The pull control is awkward to reach to open, and to close you cannot just push it shut

Satellite radio works sometimes then goes out. Other days it doesn't work at all. Took it to BMW and after 3 days they told me everything was fine and that this was a known issue from Sirius XM. I contacted XM and spoke over an hour with a technician and they told me that there is no one experiencing what I am describing in my area and that the problem is most likely from the Satellite radio Module in my car being faulty.








Suddenly it just would not always pair my phone - unable to connect or pair error message.  Then will start working suddenly.  then stop for no reason.

My I-phone 6 will say it is paired and then you press voice recog button and system and car will not accept any voice commands.  While on Phone and needing to continue call between either the car or the phone the call gets dropped some of the time once car is turned off.  System doesn't seem to hand the phone call back to phone.  My old 2008 335i BMW had this same issue.  It's annoying.

the gas peddle makes clicking noises when accelerating but does not interfere with driving.
Not sure I'm using it the correct way.  Haven't had an 'overview' teaching me about the car.

The auto windshield wiper feature doesn't seem to accurately adapt to the rain. It either doesn't wipe fast enough, and I end up tapping the controls to manually work or it cleans too quickly with a sprinkling of rain.
The automatic on/off engine feature button is too close to the regular ignition button. I often hit it by mistake and turn automatic on/off on, which is very unnerving when you're driving and don't expect it.
The drivers side seat belt is twisted. It appears to be twisted at the start, which is covered by the wall of the car. Because of the twist

Believe this to be a generic problem with the car.  Also saw it denoted on the news when they compared car headlights.  BMW scored below much inferior brands in terms of distance that the head lights reach.
The door lock mechanism was not operative due to failed solinoid : inoperative electric door lock




Most likely due to the light hue.  Suspect I will have to spend more time cleaning the seats than I would if the hue were a tan color.
It's not a misalignment. Gaps are just too wide from the hood to the headlights and to the front grille as well. It's so wide that you might think that the hood has not been totally closed.
Not intrusive. Can't hear it when you turn on the radio, except when it's coming from the window when you hit a rough pavement or bump. It's not all the time though.
Not intrusive rattling noise, but it's there. Especially when you hit even minor bumps on the freeway.

It seems almost random when the trunk unlocks after I've pressed the unlock button on my fob.  The doors always unlock but the trunk only seems to unlock every other time.
It is in a compartment under my  right arm.  I have to shut the cover on my cord if I have my iPhone plugged in while driving but out of the compartment 
I am not sure how the buttons on the seat correspond to my/my husband's keys.  When we change the key used, the seat doesn't change which makes me think we don't have one or either set up and stored.
It is hard to tell by touch if I am in gear or out of it.  I always have to look at the dashboard to make sure.  More than once after I thought I was parked, the car has moved forward on me and I realized it was still in gear.  The feel is too 'soft'.  I like the feel of a gear shift where you know it's moved.
Auto lifted not work properly. A sensor needed to be be replaced.
The indicators are on the outside rear view mirror stalk.  They are not in the direct field of gaze of the driver and have been and are easily missed.  They should be within the actual rear view mirror reflective surface since that is what the driver looks at.  I believe Audi or Mercedes has a system like this and I liked it.
The display is in the center console info screen.  You have to take your eyes off the road to look at it.  I think it is actually dangerous to use.  The display should be projected onto the windshield in the heads up display.  That would be useful.  As it is I would not get this feature again because of the display location outside of the drivers primary gaze.
The user interface to the Nav system is terrible.  It is antiquated, opaque

Passenger seat isn't nearly as warm as the driver seat.  Will have the dealer check it when we bring it in for the firs checkup.


Light colored floor mats are problem.  Dealer had promised dark brown or black but in 4 months has not delivered.  Light mats show every foot print.


The central locking system is very confusing. I miss having a button on the door and I don't understand why the lock button is in the middle of the dash. It makes no sense at all. I like the 'comfort access' system where I can unlock the car by touching the door handle, but when it is configured to only unlock the front door

Every time I use my phone, the screen display goes on and off.  This happens every time someone uses a phone in my car.  I called BMW and the technician said that it is because of bluetooth.  They are aware of the problem.  I asked if there is a fix and they said no.
When I drove the car off of the dealer lot, I noticed a message on the navigation display that said 'Drivetrain Malfunction', then it went away.  A few weeks later the message returned and happened a few times.  I took a picture of the message that reads 'Drivetrain Malfunction - You can continue driving.  No Roadside Assistance required.  Reduced engine performance.  Schedule an appointment with your service center'.  Therefore

The automatic rain sensing wiper system does not work very well.  In light drizzles and light snowing conditions the wipers do not sense the moisture and then do not activate.
The heated steering wheel button is located on the side of the steering wheel column.  The indicator light for this feature is also located there.  It looks like an after thought to me.  The button is hard to find.  The indicator light is not visible while driving.  BMW needs to fix this.  Put the button on the steering wheel itself and put the indicator light on the dashboard.

Rattles driving on bumpy road


the handle to close the front doors are not in an ergonomic-friendly position on the door panel making it harder to pull the door closed.
: I programmed my stations one day and the following day they were gone. I've had this problem several times; spoke to BMW about it recently and hopefully they've resolved the problem. I'm waiting to see if it recurs over the next month. As I'll go back and let them know again.
the headrests in the 2nd row are not adjustable; I would like to remove them to improve back window visability, but the BMW folks said they are permanent due to soft convertible top on car; the rear headrests are part of the 'roll-bar' safety system in the car.
the interior odor stems from the new materials used inside the car, I believe. I leave the windows open a bit @ night in the garage to air it out. I wonder how long it'll take to subside?
The glove box will not hold the driver's manual provided with the automobile.

: This is the same ongoing issue for BMW x5's. There is little air flow at low speeds. Meaning if you need to cool/heat you must turn the fan speed control up. Of course with this you now have more noise in the cabin. However, Ford has one of the best ac's on the market in my opinion. Always cold or hot at low speeds with the right amount of air flow

I can't quite figure out how to have fresh air circulate in the cabin.  The system seems to be on but there is very little air coming in.  And then, sometimes, a  fan will kick in and there will be a breeze.  It seems to me that I have the fan on but there just isn't enough air coming in.
Often mistakes the names of streets and states as well as numbers
Headlights as a whole are not bright enough. I find I have to use the high beans at night.
Excessive wind noise when the windows are open. Occurs even if the window is open just a crack.
: Voice recognition does not work until I am on the highway and frequently misintepets my command, especially when I am changing radio stations.
Many times the navigation system tells me that navigation is not operational when it should be. I plan on talking to the dealership when I take the vehicle in for servicing.
Radio commands seem to work fine most of the time.  Navigation is another story.  Will typically choose another state than the one I'm saying and the pronunciation is not close.  Also does not give me enough time to say the whole address.
: My phone is paired with the car, but it won't pick up audio from my phone.  Although the phone connectivity works.
it's a very complicated system which I probably would understand better if I had a manual.  Sitting for a 1+ hour class with the BMW genius was not enough.  I was getting overloaded with information.  Also, don't understand what actions to take when the nav is telling you there is a problem ahead.
Limited height for cups and difficult to get them in and out.

It was a faulty seatbelt sensor
BMW should include the full automatic locking to cover the passenger side glove compartment when the retractable convertible to is in the down position. It is ridiculous to expect the driver to remove the valet key,then lock the glove compartment and replace the key in the holder. Someone was not thinking straight in my humble opinion.
: The hardtop convertible roof would intermitantly not lift back up. On the second attempt the service foreman realized that it was a defective switch that was the problem.

Difficult to locate. Can't tell if it's on or off because the light and button are under the steering column.
You need to open the door to see which buttons are which.
It's coming from the passenger side of the car. It may be the seat or the door panel.
It is the only electronic device on the car I cannot intuitively work.  I have read the manual and had training at the dealer but I cannot get the hang of it.
Still figuring out
: Navigation map shows random stuff, should be 'fixed' by software update, haven't happened again yet
May have something to do with weather
: Driver seat seems to lose memory for the #1 preset and moves to the setting for the 2nd memory button.
: The sensor for opening the trunk using my foot frequently doesn't work. I assume it is because the sensor gets dirty from normal driving.
Brakes emit a high pitched squeak in cold weather and in reverse. Taking it into the dealer tomorrow.

wind noise is more audible when slowing down
the rubber cover on the door would sometimes be out of place
its bothersome when you rest your arm on top of it
its bit out of reach when you are driving
There is an issue, where to fully close the cover over the gas cap, the doors must be unlocked - forcing you to hit the unlock button on your fob.

Door unlock is located in the center of the dash board. Is difficult to unlock when you are picking up your car from a valet because you do not have the Fob on you to unlock. You must fully get into the car before you can let your passengers enter.



happens in eco mode by design, not malfunction
I had a back passenger door seal that was defective on delivery of car it was hanging out door, the dealership replaced it but after that the front passenger door stuck for a while, after about a month it seems fine now. I had an appointment for them to look at it within 2 days of repair but had to cancel and never remade appointment.
Its not the latch it is the auto open sensor where i am supposed to be able to open trunk by waving foot under car, it never works unless i stand there waving my foot for 2-3 minutes. I tried many variations of waving and sticking my foot under tailgate.
When trying to put cups in or remove the dash protrudes above it a little and causes spills and frustration. it's not broken it is poorly designed.
They are too small to use with a lot of reusable water bottles. Would like them to be larger.

The interior seems to be designed for durability first and 'sound studio silence' second. The trim panels and door panels tick or click as the interior warms or cools or over some bumps, I expect this tolerance is designed into the system to prevent louder noises as the vehicle ages.

The brakes are very tight especially at low speeds.  They 'bite' to easily.  It is hard to have a smooth stop from a low speed.. example sitting and traffic and inching forward.

I have not yet determined how to save my favorite satellite stations on the menu. MENU IS SO COMPLICATED AND TOO LONG.

Also the navigation destination order is rigid and does a poor job of capturing what I say. Google and Siri both are easier to use. Also the nav is less accurate at estimating traffic and routing creatively around it vs Google  maps
Blue tooth interrupts calls turns on radio and then switches back after about 15 seconds. Once this starts it happens again and again on a call. Sometimes it doesn't happen at all. Can't detect a pattern.

: the control gauge for radio,NULL, etc.  freezes, does not move up or down, have to toggle to the left to get it started again


There is no engine temperature gauge.  Similarly, no engine oil dip stick.  Checking engine oil is buried in a sub menu of the I-drive system.  Haven't been able to find the air filter yet either.
The 'I-drive' system takes considerable getting used to.  There are many menus to work through.  It is not obvious in which sub-menu some functions are located.  The system actually has tremendous capability, however it is overly complex.  In some respects it is hazardous to use while driving as it takes a fair amount of attention to do some simple functions such as change a radio station that is not pre-programed.  Using the pre-program buttons takes some getting used to also.  since it is not possible to label the buttons once they are programed you are forced to remember them which is an issue if they are not used regularly.  The dash board display does not contain an engine coolant temperature gauge.



The glass panel is noisy when there is body flex, bumps and uneven roads.



Passenger side of the hood is a quarter inch too high. Not flush with the rest of the front panels like the driver side is.

I'm not sure if I am listing this as the correct problem - it's in the Eco-Pro mode, gas-conservation - and I feel the engine stumble a bit each time it re-engages.
Was told before signing paperwork at BMV Beverly Hills, they would correct the roughly idling which I feel vibrates too much for a luxury vehicle... but when I took it in to have it adjusted they said

The tailgate is easy to open and close unless you are trying to open it by swinging your foot under the tailgate. The hands-free method of opening the tailgate is difficult to use.

Using dial to enter address information is much more cumbersome than a touch screen


the 'no-hands' opening feature does not work at all.  The trunk lid will only open a few inches when the outside handle or inside button are used.
the no hands opening feature has never worked properly.  Dealer can't fix it.
The door handles have to be pulled twice to open the doors.  I know that this a BMW feature but I am not a fan of it.  Would rather have to pull the door handles only once.  Also, I don't care for the lock button on the center of the dash.  It is out of the way if you are standing outside of the car.  Would rather have it on the inside door.
Nav system often 'mis-hears' voice commands.

: Driver side front seat squeaks. The plastic around the bottom left rubs against the leather and squeaks when you go over a bump or move around in the seat.
Doesn't recognize my command quite often
: Ventilation controls did not function properly in all settings. But I kept readjusting the controls and they finally started working again. My BMW dealer also noted these problems. So if the ventilation system malfunctions again, I will return the car for repair. At this point, it's just a wait and see issue.

There are entirely too many options to choose from.  Why should there be 5 different settings for headlights.  This is true about so many features of the car.  TOO MANY CHOICES that are not necessary.
I don't know how much detail you can provide.  It just doesn't recognize my voice.
This system should be touch screen.  It is difficult to input unless you stop the car and sit with it for several minutes.  I'm not comfortable with the voice commands.  It doesn't understand me.
The floor mat is cheap and not secured well so it slides all the time and causes a problem when driving.

The issue is the phone will be connected to the blue tooth system and then disconnects within a few feet the phone will connect back to the car. I just use my speaker phone for now until they fix the problem.
Useless. Rarely understands words and numbers.

Self parking system let the car hit the curb and caused curb rash on the front wheel.
Not user friendly.  The manual doesn't explain the features well.

The audio feature that plays music from the phone does not sync information in a timely manner, often needing more than 5 minutes to begin playing music and/or displaying song information. In addition, it is sometimes necessary to initiate playing music from the phone for the audio to work.

Button to turn on heated steering wheel is located under the steering column.  Have to feel around to find it.  Indicator light is red when on, but it is impossible to see unless you bend down and look under the steering wheel.  This is impossible to do while driving.  Should have placed it at an easier to locate position that is viewable when driving.
Cigarette lighter/power outlet located right by the cup holders.  Always hit the power cord when putting cups in and out of cup holders.  Plus, never good idea to mix electricity with liquids.

When the warning light went on, I experimented with the menus and saw the maintenance indicator of low windshield washer fluid.  However, the dealer thought the issue was mostly with lower tire pressure in cooler weather and filled the tire.  Also the dealer could not confirm what had caused the warning using the key.
Having to choose streets seems to be problematic.  Limiting places of entertainment to 60 miles seems sort of limiting.  I have not been very successful yet at getting the voice recognition to work with the navigation system.
Occurred unexpectedly 6 weeks after purchasing vehicle.  Light went on.  Was not looking for spills.

I'm not used to the idea of not being able to open the rear passenger door after exiting the vehicle from the driver's side.  I would prefer not to have to hit the door lock inside the vehicle before exiting.

The navigation system periodically does not recognize when I am on an access road along a highway and will give me different route directions as if I had not exited.  I also have had an issue with the navigation system not recognizing the changes of a highway location and it will show the car off the road and continue to re-calculate.  These situations do not happen often but I have noticed it a few times since I have had the BMW X4 in December of 2015.

Main brake sensor went out on Christmas eve with only 2000 miles on bmw. Had to tow and repair. Took a few weeks to fix.









: There is a thumbwheel on the wiper level on the right hand side of the steering wheel. This thumbwheel is supposed to be used to set the frequency or sensitivity of the rain sensor from the manual descriptions. However, I tried turning the thumbwheel up and down but I could not feel any speed change of wiper. I found out this problem when I drove my car in the first rainy day.

Wipers either too slow or too fast.  My last car had more than 2 speeds

Starting car is perfect but shutting down is inconvenient. Push button once to shutdown engine and while engine stops the car goes into a 'radio-ready' state in which the accessories are still powered on. They only turn off if you exit car and lock doors OR push start button a second time. I should be able to shutdown engine and everything turns off. If I want to listen to the radio then I would push start button to power up the accessories. Other cars are programmed this way and I like that. OR, it should be an end-user configuration choice.
The Park Assist feature ONLY automatically activates when putting car into reverse. It doesn't automatically activate when pulling directly into a parking space while still moving forward. There is a manual button to activate under these circumstances but I've owned both a Volvo and a Porsche that were automatic and highly convenient this way. BMW should turn on the system automatically when it detects a nearby object even if you are moving forward.
: Squeak that seems to be located at joint between driver's side window and convertible roof, somewhere along the top horizontal edge region of window.
The engine restart seems to be slow as if the engine doesn't startup 'instantly'. Consequently a slight delay when pulling out from stops. This is only a short delay but having had the feature in other cars, I know that other engines can start slightly faster.
Trunk was supposed to be a power opening. It would only open 1/4 way.
The locking lugs were over-tightened when I received the car.  It broke the key when the there was an attempt to change the tires.
It is much louder than my MDX.
Doesn't understand commands.  Poor command menu structure. Not intuitive for many items. Can't find items in menu structure where they should logically be.

The car is equipped with Halogen headlights and I thought I was getting xenon lights. If you use the BMW 'build your own' website and click on the packages tab the screen that shows up appears to indicate you are getting the xenon lights due to a check mark in the box. After purchasing the car I found out that the check in the box does not provide the Xenon lights. I am very disappointed and the dealership didn't want to do anything about it, although they offered to get me a new  car if I would pay them another $9000.00.

Most of the issue seems to relate to the correct prefacing command which seems to need to follow the right sequence using the right words. Example,NULL, 14 Smith Street, etc. versus 'I need directions to .....'

When I plug in my phone charger it has to be set just right for the power to remain on.  Luckily there is a light on the plug to know it is working.  It seems to not fit well in the receptacle.

Hard to close when you put things inside such as the owner manual or a cd pouch. You must perfectly align the interior contents or else it will not close.

It's another side effect of the poor cup holder area design. The plug is between to cup holders. Who does that? The cable running from there can easily get tangled up between cups and pulling it can cause spillage of liquid and major distraction. It's neither safe nor convenient. Again they should have gone with the BMW 328i sedan design for cup holders.
The navigation is almost useless. I use my phone's google map navigation instead. It doesn't show the movement correctly on the big screen. The road navigation is on the front console almost obstructed by steering wheel. Even when you lean forward to see it it's difficult to understand because of small single color simpleton sketches that are supposed to represent the road!!! I'd give 1 out of 10 to the nav system on this vehicle.
It's difficult to adjust because of the clip/latch location. This is for all vehicles. The industry should think of a better way to adjust the headrest.
The cup holder has a sliding top. When closed it can be used to place something on it. You cannot use that place for putting something there and keeping a cup at the same time. The design is kinda stupid. BMW 328i sedan has a better design for that area. They should have gone with that.

This car is equipped with dual front seat zone controls that allow a temperature to be set.  The system apparently will not activate AC when needed to lower temperature to the set point, while heating does occur as needed.  AC must be manually selected when needed.

It's really a pain in the ___ to program favorite stations but also have the ability to seek other stations. It seems to me that a simple station 'seek' button could take care of this annoyance.




Under moderate to hard acceleration the car/wheel pulls in both directions..  Same happens under moderate to hard braking.. The vehicle has a tendency to pull to the right
Sound quality  is good. Navigating menus frustrating as hell.. Nothing intuitive..Borderline dangerous to use while driving, even the simplest of tasks require taking your eye of the road... The menus and the method to navigate them is a JOKE!!!  VERY Dangerous and terroribly cumbersome system!! One of the worst designed audio systems I have ever encountered.. All of BMW's systems are awful and DANGEROUS !!
Again a car at this price should have electric adjustable seats !!!

I've not been able to adjust any of the headrest.  Also, wanted to remove the headrest in the back - middle section because it obstructs the view out the rear window, but looks like that is NOT allowed.   But couldn't get it to move either - as to make it lower.   So just can't see out the rear window very well.
Actually - I just didn't see an option - but the passenger seat belt rattles all the time.  And this is while the windows are up - so it's not from the wind blowing.  Obviously, nobody is using the passenger seat belt.   Also - when go to put on the driver's seat belt - it sticks along the side.   It's just a small car - so no room for the seat belt portion to get through unless it's at the right angle.
poor location
I think I understand now but had a hard time understanding what locked/unlocked automatically


The location of my Harmon Kardon speakers in the front of the vehicle gives it POOR sound quality. Maybe additional speakers should be placed on the lower front doors

Scuff marks on the dashboard, door panel material and exterior glove compartment are difficult to wipe off



The style of the back latch is nice to release but no good handle to grab and lift open.  Friend pinched fingers trying to open the release and then again trying to lift the hatch.
Too easy to pinch fingers.  You have to 'know' where the release is located and carefully flip it to release then try to get your fingers under the hatch and lift without pinching.  Wish there was an easy knee release and electric open.
I find the multi-levels difficult to navigate

Sorry Mini dropped down to cheap materials and not the good leather seats with BMW.  Prior Mini 2010 had great leather seats that were easy care and showed no wear.  These new fabric pleather combo seats have to constantly be vacuumed and I am concerned will wear quickly and snag easily.

this is actually the lock control on this vehicle, knees hit the controls and unlock/lock the doors repeatedly.
lock controls are in a bad place, knees hit the controls.  see other comments.
I assumed it would sync up to the correct time but I had to adjust to be accurate
the camera will sometimes not work, if I open/close the trunk it will 'jar' it back into place and will work again.

The turn signals are supposed to have two levels.  A light touch  is supposed to have the signal only go off about three times ,NULL, the turn signal is supposed to stay on .   I continually think I have done the 'light touch' signal and then find I am driving down the road with my turn signal still activated.

Clock loses about 4 to 5 minutes each month
car interior is confined so making adjustments to the seats are difficult.

There is a lot of plastic trim so you need to be very mindful that you don't hit the interior with anything sharp or it scratches easily. The other problem is just with a black interior it shows everything.

They took away the super special Mini Cooper secret compartment in the dashboard! :(


The vents in my prior mini were easy to use and seemed to have great range.  My new mini vents do not seem to have as wide a range and the knobs seem flimsy.








I am 4'10' so it is hard to reach to close. It would be better if there was a leather strap hanging down.
It is hard to operate the adjustment knob while you are sitting in the seat.
It is cream colored so it scuffs/soils from his shoes or backpack when my teenage son gets in/out of the car.  To be expected from the light color I chose.
The ignition start is a push down leaver just under the controls for the climate control system.  It is just above the storage area on the center console.  I think it could be accidentally pressed.  I thought the position of the ignition button on the 2009 Mini Clubman was a more appropriate location.  This is a design issue and there is nothing the dealer can do to resolve.

It does not consistently shut down. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not work.
When driving on the highway at high speeds the car doesn't hold the road. I am constantly having to adjust making it a particularly rough ride for passengers in the back. Also I feel like I might lose control of the car.  If I had done a highway test I never would have chosen the mini.  This is actually my families 5th Mini Cooper. My husband has always been the primary driver and I always complained to him about his driving deteriorating but after the first time I took the car on the highway I realized it's not him its the car.   I truly wish I could give the car back. I am now so nervous on the highway.
When I am locking the door without the key from the outside with the little black button I have to press the button multiple times.
It is too small. I also feel in todays market it should have come with the back up mirror.

The new controls on the 2016 Mini are extremely frustrating. The screen and menus have too many steps and sub menus that require too much attention to use while driving. I used to be able to select one button for my iPhone, radio or CD player and now those options are multi step operations which are hazardous to complete while driving because of the number of steps and need to read the screen. There is nothing user friendly in this interface.
The ports are obstructed by the parking brake handle and can only be accessed easily when the vehicle is parked.
The Mini says my iPhone6 is paired and my iPhone says it is paired with the Mini but I am unable to play music via my iPhone. The telephone options work and my contact list is available. When paired with the Mini, my iPhone will not play music even on its own so I am unable to use my music in the car. The pairing process is not straightforward and is difficult to find the correct menu options to pair phone. The user manual is not helpful as I have walked through the steps there several times without success. In addition, the user manual jumps from section to section during the steps and actually takes me through a circle that offers no remedy to the issue.

You need to use a Y cable to connect your iPod/iPhone, which is below the handbreak. It is hard to access and visible to any outsider that would like to steal your device. There is an insert for the armrest you can purchase, which is very expensive and is limited to what devices you can plug into it. There should be a usb connection inside the armrest

The sun visors are extremely small. The driver's side has one in the front and one on the side, both of which have a lot of gaps for the sun to come through. The passenger side only has one sun visor and when switched to the side position it only take up about 2/3 of the window leaving a huge gap that the sun gets through.

FCD14: Door Locks/Keyless Entry - Controls/Icons DTU/Poor Location
The cable included with the car does not work with current technology.  In addition, the connectivity is spotty at best and it seems to default to only playing a handful of songs when connected to my iPhone, versus any number of the 5000 songs to choose from.
The location is inconvenient and the cable provided is so short the phone really has no place to go.
The position of the exterior-side mirrors are placed too low and from the driver seat I cannot see the bottom of both mirrors but particularly the passenger side mirror  because it is blocked by the passenger door panel.

Did not have the cover inserted into slots due to load I was carrying. When I tried to open the rear door, the string holding the cover broke when the cover got caught in the load.
I think this noise is due to the run-flat tires!

It just works differently than the last Blu Tooth system I had and I think I haven't used it enough to figure it out.
I did not expect to have dirt showing already on my leather seats in only 3 months time.
: The center console is too high in it's normal position to be comfortable and kind of in the way when pulled up.
I will often keep my key on me as that seems to be the easiest way to use keyless entry however often I will walk past the rear of the car and the door will swing open. It almost hit my child once. Also I wish there was an auto unlock for all doors when shifted into park. If there is one I haven't found it.









Remote unlock feels inconsistent w/ 1, 2, and 3 clicks. It's difficult to open the rear doors when carrying a child in one arm. Consider sensors that do not require pressing unlock buttons. My Lexus RX is excellent w/ unlocking.
Connection to blue tooth is inconsistent. Volume also inconsistent between radio, blue tooth, phone speaker volume

The main problem boils down to the controls and menu options are not 'intrinsically obvious.'  Engineers should test control options and logic with non-engineers.
It was a flat tire - not sure what caused it.

The location of the belt connector is in a very poor spot.  It is too far back and it is difficult to find it and lock the belt in position.  Literally have to try and turn sideways to find it and lock it in properly.  They should be moved forward a little.





There are swirls in the black paint on the top. The dealer tried to buff out but it didn't help. I took it through an automatic car wash once. This is one that I took my black BMW through semi-regularly and never had problems. Unfortunately I don't know if the swirls were there when picked it up. The dealer told me that Mini's paint is too soft for car washes so now I'm not taking any chances and hand washing every time which is cumbersome.
Would be helpful if it told you what the pressure should be so you knew how low the tires are.
The clock doesn't keep accurate time. I've reset it three times in the three months I've owned it.
Overall difficult to use.
Handle is in awkward location and difficult to turn.

steering tilt lever is located to close to the instrumentation panel and dashboard.
it is not functional to have carpet installed in the cargo area.  Since this area is meant to carry cargo should have a rubber cargo mat installed in order to absorb the soil and dirt from hauling cargo in that area.

On one occasion it couldn't recognize or find an address. On several occasions,  the directions to turn where unclear or came too late to get in the proper lane to make the turn. This was a problem when traffic was heavy.
The panel that fits in the rear cargo area to make the floor of the trunk level doesn't slide on /out easily.
Placed too high and too far back making it awkward to open. The compartent has an adapter which only works for certain iphone models and takes up space. Part of it is removable but doesn't leave a finished look as part of the adapter is fixed in place and is exposed.

I worry about having an accident while I'm trying to use the nav system, which is hardly the point of having it.
It feels as if the engine and transmission are poorly paired, as if we should have chosen the regular  engine size.
Perhaps this is a problem with the optional automatic/paddle shift transmission.

The front seats of my new Mini have a feature called 'thigh support'.  It hits my leg at the back of the knee--I am short--and this can get uncomfortable after driving for a time.  The seat in my 2006 Mini was much more comfortable for me. This is not something that can be repaired.

Clock loses about 10 minutes every week.
Feet can rub against each other when working pedals which are side-by side.
The Sirius/XM radio seems to have more drop out areas than on my previous vehicle. I suspect the radio does not have enough buffer memory.
Cup holders too close to controls on face of dash board.
It seems the clutch pedal has too much of  a range of travel. Leg must be extended too far to get pedal all the way down.
Doesn't seem like there is enough air coming out and the air coming out is not cool enough.  I have to leave in Max A/C mode all the time and that is very noisy.
Door panel and cargo area rubber liner show marks easily. They are also easily cleaned. Dirt shows prominently on the black carpet.

I think it has to do with the run flat tires and the low clearance of the vehicle that contribute to the noise,NULL, or newly paved roads.

The Voice command system misunderstand and misinterprets names of places etc. Also the navigation is frequently inaccurate or not the most efficient way to get to a location vs waze or googlemaps.
This is just a design flaw.  If a passenger uses the usb port for their iphone to charge their phone, but I am using my phone for music, my phone will be kicked out of the system without notification or permission.

Carplay system does not pick up voice despite confirmed connection to iPhone.
My understanding is that once my iPhone is paired to Carplay, there is no need to re-pair. I frequently need to pair my iPhone to Carplay each time I start the car. After the Carplay is connected, because connectivity is lost,  I would occasionally need to re-pair my iPhone while driving. Unsafe!

Controls for seat height adjustment are not intuitive.
Car has no AM radio.  The HD FM radio is not sufficient.  Reception is poor outside of downtown area, and not all AM stations have equivalent HD FM channels.
It's not really hard to open or close, but it sometimes takes one or two tries to find the right spot to push for the latch to disengage/engage.  Door has a plasticky 'give'.  Inside, the charging port lid is attached to a rubbery 'cord' that feels like it might get stuck in the door or get in the way.  I feel I must 'tuck it in' carefully, for the door latch to connect.  It is a very minor inconvenience, so I don't feel the need to have it corrected.
There is not a digital clock reading that is always there, I have to flip around on the dial to find it, which is annoying

: I think I have turned off the engine as I lock the car from the outside but several times to my surprise the engine is still running and I don't realize it until I return home.
Perhaps I have not tried out controls on my wheel which is part of inadequate introduction to car.  I think I can use more help.  But when I am driving and I am the only driver I cannot  do much driving as it would be unsafe. : sometimes my podcasts bounces out of contact and goes back to radio which us difficult to control while driving.

AC needs to be charged - I'm assuming thats the problem but haven't had it diagnosed yet.
there is a built in charger in the middle console that does not fit or change to fit my I- phone, only Samsung,should be changeable for other brands
downshifting below 10-15 mph is clunky ,when in fully auto.The paddles are fantastic and the transmission feels great at all speeds over 25mph : under 10 mph the transmission shifts are clunky, you can feel the down shifts under your butt.
sub woofers seem to have blown out
: When exterior is wet  water appears to drop into trunk when hatch is opened.
Not clear if memory of seat position has been stored
Front defogging needs to be constantly on rather than on for a normal period before returning to regular climate control. : In addition to fogging, ice appears to build up on the exterior during snow conditions if the front defogger is not constantly on
When temperatures are cold there is a noticeable crack/slap noise when going over bumps
I did  change my Bmw series2 for the coupe series 4
very hard to understand
Area to too tight for larger cups & water bottles
i lose signal in the middle of driving on 280 freeway palo alto - stanford and it gets intermittent listening to WILD HD and STAR HD station which i enjoy the most.
On occasion lamp turns on and stars beeping as if I didn't buckle up. But I did and have been for a while. It ususally stops after two minutes of beeping while driving. Very distracting and annoying.
: The cover on the rear windshield wiper came off.
: The driver's door does not stay open long enough to exit the vehicle.
There is small indentation at the left door that I have not noticed when I got the car, but I noticed it as soon as I parked it at the first stop.
: When iPhone 6s is connected and the first call is made the audio is garbled and call has to be cancelled.
Leather color is oyster, which is very light and jeans leave very noticeable blue ""tint"" on it. I was expecting this problem based on previous BMW cars I had,
: When AC or heating reaches set temperature the system start to deliver air that has a musty smell to it 
The tire pressure keeps going down and I keep filling it up and it is impossible to tell if it is actually a flat tire or not.  It seems to be weather related because it happens when it is cold at night but when the weather gets warmer it is fine.
If I'm driving and just stopped in bumper to bumper traffic it is SUPER annoying to have the beeping noise go off.  I only need this when trying to park and not when I'm just in regular traffic and driving.  It is distracting and potentially more of a hazard actually.  It sucks.
Small high-pitched wind leak between drivers window and door.
They feel underpowered for the size of the vehicle.  It makes the car feel unstable when stopping.
This is the most disappointing aspect of the car.  I hate that I paid extra for the Nav option, only to have to use my cell phone because the Nav system can't provide basic directions.  It constantly thinks locations are on the wrong side of the road, and is always demanding U-Turns when they are not required.  It's so bad that I don't even try to use it anymore.
doesnt park straight/even.  sometimes car is sticking out into street.  Don't trust system any more
Not intuitive to understand to pull loop located at bottom of seat to fold rear seat.
Have to remove / re-assemble multiple separate pieces / steps to remove / replace cargo cover, panel orientation is not inuitive or labeled for proper assembly.  too many steps and is cumbersome to align tabs and pins
The switch to turn auto shut down on off is poorly located and gets engaged accidentally.  Button / system use is not intuitive.  System works as intended, this is just a design issue.
The ConnectDrive interface to the navigation system is confusing when trying to enter and removed destinations.  Additionally, it is very strict about address format.  Address entries in by Contacts loaded from my phone via the Bluetooth connection are not reliably recognized as addresses, although Google Maps does properly identify them.  The dealer worked with me to identify the issue, but it isn't something they can fix.
steering wheel appears too loose. very hard to control cars at highway speed, or at windy condition.
Colored control wheels and instructions are difficult to understand and use. Owner's manual not helpful.
The Cargo Mat sold to me by the dealership is too large for the cargo area. This is odd, as it is a BMW product.
: Within three days of purchase, the check engine light illuminated. I took the vehicle to the nearest BMW dealership. They examined it and told me that the vehicle had not been ""PDI'd"" by the dealership that sold it to me. This resulted in a ""high voltage cooling system failure"". The vehicle remained at the shop for five days. I contacted the selling dealership about this, but they have just ignored me. The wife and I had to cancel a road trip because of this. I do not know what the long term effects on the vehicle will be.
Phone in Apple Car play has very bad ""interference"" ""crackling"" nearly can't use the phone without annoyance.
just seems loud at max air
Air shuts off when motor shuts down- can't sit and ""idle"" as the motor will shut down, electric motor doesn't stay on, so can't really sit in the car for very long idling without cooking passengers inside
On all BMWs, when I touch the blinker to change lanes, it continues to blink after I change, and I have to push the knob the other direction to turn it off, and sometimes it does not turn off, or it will blink in the other direction.  On other cars, when I use the turn signal to change lanes, it automatically turns off after I change lanes.
Touch lock and keyless entry had never worked.
One scratch on rim about a inch long
drivers side mirror had scratch on carbon fiber about two inches long. By the time papers were signed, it was night time.
: The windshield has a sand-blast effect.  It may not have been well protected/shielded in transport.  The effect is on of small star bursts on the windshield. This did not occur on my previous car until it was old.
Sensor in a difficult to access location
Too easy to activate the signal in the opposite direction when turning off. Design flaw, not malfunction
Only pipe seemed to emit anything, it has since corrected itself?
Don't think this is a problem but is related more to M4 suspension and tires.
I took the car back two weeks after purchasing for a detailing.  I noticed the scratch a few days after.
run flat tires degrade overall performance of vehicle.  We removed tires at time of delivery and replaced with NON run flat tires
: when multiple bluetooth devices are synced and present to iDrive system in vehicle often times will stop functioning
The interior lights did not turn on when you open the door.
The triangle is small and shall be on the mirror.
Shaking  and vibrating too much and too often even when one  is just slightly off course. Not like the shaking of the steering wheel
Never know whether the car is too close to the car in front or whether the car will automatically break to stop if it is too close to the car in front.
The navigation system could not be turned on. Nothing on screen and no radio. All controls for the navigation and radio also did not work. After stopped and restarted the engine, it was back to normal. It happens just once, about 2 months after delivery.
There is no numeric display next to the tire. All I see is a colored light.
I think this is user error. I've tried a few times. Just can't get it to work.
When I have the auto mode set, the fan should automatically go to the highest speed and then automatically slow as the desired temperature is reached, period. There shouldn't be multiple fan user adjustment speeds in the auto mode. If i have to adjust sppe  then that's not auto to me.
:  There is a small panel that goes over the tow bar in the rear of the car.  The panel was not secured and fell off a couple of weeks after I took possession of the vehicle, leaving a open hole.    I am also not happy with the plastic front bumper.  The bumper was resting against a shelving unit in our garage and there is now a indentation in the plastic bumper that won't go away.  According to the dealer, it will cost to $450 fix it !
Does not appear to register lane departure at times.  Maybe I am missing something.  Need to talk with the dealer.
: A passenger restraint system malfunction warning came on for several days.  Seemed to resolve itself before I got the car back to the dealer.
: I have an ipod connected to the car. When trying to switch from album to another album, it constantly stalls and replays a song over and over and i have to cut the radio system off and then start again.
You have to leave the center console open in order to use the ports.
Brakes sometimes squeaked when I was reversing and it was very cold outside.
Navigation is slow with turn by turn directions and to tell you the side of the street your location is.
loose steering at comfort mode, and tighter steering at sport mode
Tire has a slow leak and does not maintained pressure
The AC and Audi buttons seen to be reversed for where they should be
The AC controls and music controls are mixed : The passages side AC button has a 3 position airflow but the system only allows 2 positions
I have had the hand brake issue mostly when the car is in the drive gear no gas pedal used and I feel the car move. But when I place the car in Park and use the hand brake it will not move. The first situation happens when I think it is in park but it is not and I use the hand brake it will still want to move forward or backward depending if I am on a flat surface or backing out down the driveway.
: being able to lift the windshield wipers in order to clean the windshield. This feature is not easy and has caused me to inadvertly scrape the paint off the inside of hood.
using my smart phone in the car through bluetooth will often say phone not connected. It will show my phone but wants me to manually continue to connect it. I leave my iPod classic connected to the usb port and don't know if it is causing the clash between multiple devices trying to communicate to the car-such as iPhone and iPod.
: the small storage space below the steering wheel did not close all the way and it bruised my right leg getting in last week.
Looks like glue of some sort along the edge of the hood; I haven't yet tried to remove it, but it MIGHT come off with ""bug cleaner"".
In damp weather, the driver's side windshield seems to fog up and I have to turn on the defroster to clear it.   After a bit, it happens again.
It's the same with all electronic steering, just isn't the same feel as hydraulic.
The edge of the sunglasses case is sharp and I cut my leg while getting in.
I can't discern a pattern to this problem. Sometimes it wont connect and other times it drops connections. It seems to help when I turn blue tooth off on my phone and then reset.
I have found several areas on the car where the glue from the protective plastic shipping coating was not removed and attracts dirt.
I assume what I am smelling is the ""new"" leather...while mildly unpleasant, the odor has not risen to the level of requiring dealer attention.
Uneven paint spray under trunk near trunk handle. Primer can still be seen in edges. Paint also has excessive orange peel look.
Headlights have poor lighting past 100ft, lights seemed to be aimed too low
Unable to play music from phone or unable to connect with BMW Connected App
The trunk has a hands-free opening mechanism where you use your foot to open the trunk.  This is very difficult to get to work.  Sometimes it works first try and sometimes not at all after multiple tries.
I first noticed the problem at freeway speeds when the passenger seat is not occupied.  The seat vibrates visibly and makes a rattling or shaking noise
When compared to the 2014 328i I drove for three years, this SULEV car sometimes has a deadzone in the acceleration process where I step on the accelerator and there is an approximate 1-2 second delayed response.  So much so that I have almost had the pedal to the floor before it starts to accelerate.  It is the most disappointing aspect of this car because with previous BMW 328i  the response was always instantaneous.
In sport mode after accelerating, it sometimes gets stuck and hesitates to downshift when it is supposed to - almost goes to a neutral rev
The fan speed control button makes an odd click when pressed.
The control button to increase the airflow 'feels' odd and makes a strange clicking sound when pressed.
: I have been unable to load my telephone contacts to the car's system
Matts are 'sticky' on top side of driver and passenger side, collect dirt easily and looks worn after only two months
At times will drop calls as I'm driving . Has nothing to do with cell service but rather Bluetooth will turn off or suddenly can't be found therefore dropping my call and making it difficult and distracting as I'm driving to figure out what's wrong. At  other times when I try to make a phone call I can not hear anything but I see that my phone call is going through when I look at my cell - other times people may call me but I am unable to hear them. Another Bluetooth issue??   This doesn't happen all the time, just randomly. Doesn't matter if I'm driving, parked or stopped at a light.
About 1 month post delivery, i realized that the dealership did not remove adhesive from letters that were on the back of the car. I assume these were letters from the previous dealership - I can almost read them.
MY moon roof exploded while driving
phone mic doesnt always pick up my voice. i have to tilt my head upward toward speaker thing to speak on the phone
Its in the center consul.  when i put the wire in to connect and shut the consul top repeatedly, it ruins the wire.
i could not even think to try to use this function if windows were cracked or open.  its bad either idle or moving.
see previous notes
i expect better for what i paid
please refer to my previous comment. Glass exploded udring driving. Upon return of my car post service, i realized they did not vaccuum all the glass out of the tracks. also, i now hear glass ships rattle while driving.
i got better mileage on my 2014 then on my 2017 diesel
RPMs stay high when going down hill. does not shift properly
It is by design that they are too close together, not by manufacturer defect.
It is only sometimes. Usually restarting my phone fixes it, but the other day, my phone connected to CarPlay, but the display screen froze even after restarting my phone.
: Center console has a wireless charging option for a cell phone. Unfortunately my new Samsung S7 will not fit in the cradle, so I'm unable to use this feature.  No repair available from dealer.
Tires are poor quality. I had a puncture from a very small object that pierced the tread quite easily.
: Text to voice or display of text will not pair with my Apple iPhone 6s
voice recognition is only accurate when using my phone as the backend...the built in is utterly useless...
bluetooth sometimes doesnt connect, when skipping tracks or searching the lag is unbearable
Maps are constantly poor, no way to use google maps or waze instead
the route it takes me is often inconvenient or longer than a google map/waze route, and there is no way to fix or use my phone for data
cosmetic problems only, can be easily fixed with a wash or detailing job
The water leaks into the car at the car wash.  It happens at the front pillars where the roof posts meet the top of the pillar.    The dealer said that this is a normal occurrence.
The high beams do not seem to light up the road as well as the low beams.
First few times brakes are used when starting out, they make noise when applied.  It occurs when leaving the driveway & stopping at the first stop sign .  Then I park the car at work for 12-16 hours and it will occur again, at times.
It is positioned rather low and the only little gathering place for change, chapstick, or my phone is in the same place. when you have a 3 ft aux cord, cannot place the phone near you too easily.
Inside the glove box is the manual, 1 pair of sunglasses, 1 hair brush and a truck driver style Bluetooth.  My passenger needs to turn knees sideways, so that I may open it.  Upon opening, the hair brush and Bluetooth always slide out.  It is not large enough to include the following items (that were also in my old glove box: 1 bottle of Motrin, 4 fold-up maps of other states, cell cigarette charger, and garmin.
The area inside the console is not wide enough for my employee name badges, house keys, small flashlight and mace. It isn't very long and it keeps moving up when the parking break is pulled.
I alerted the dealer to the problem.  He promised to call me to fix it.  He did not.  I called him and sent pictures.  No response.
Not a big deal. It doesn't happen every time; only occasionally. Very faint.
squeak/rattle noise when convertible roof is closed or sunroof is open
Always had a problem with Siri recognising specific instructions, commands.  Same with this system.  Told that it would 'learn', but I am sceptical.
Never been able to use properly
The belt gets twisted in the guide on the pillar post
Just noticed with the recent rain I have been having that sometime I am not sure lights are on. I know they are because interior lights are on but just doesn't seem bright enough
I feel I am always making the volume higher. The many menus to  save a station are at first confusing until you play with it for a bit. But most times you are driving when you are working things out so just a few too many steps but I know it's because there is so much offered and so many options.
The design in the seat which are small holes are tough to get clean if food gets stuck in them
When you get in the car, if you don't pick up your feet and they hit the door sills they marked,scratched and the scratch is permanent.
The problem is related to the sensor under the car to open the rear cargo doors. Difficult to get the sensor to activate. Several times we've not had any success. Very nice idea but doesn't appear to work well.
The center console holders are difficult to use with insulated mugs, due to the close proximity of each holder it won't allow the use of the second holder. The holder in each door panel is not deep enough to be used.
With dress shoes - mens - it is too close
I don't like to slam my doors so I use enough force to close them. All doors close just fine except the front driver door. The same amount of force leaves door half open/closed. Too often I need to reopen and close again using more force.
Brakes don't have enough stopping power
same as topic reason
: The AC is not very forceful
same as topic reason
Poorly designed back doors. Must first open front doors to let someone in and out from back and if there is an existing passenger in the front, they have to unbuckle first. Back doors must close first before front ones can.
It doesn't seem to have ""normal"" brakes, since with the i3 braking is almost never needed if space is maintained and one removes foot off pedal. However, when reacting to other drivers, sometimes braking is necessary, and the grinding noise is heard then.
: Any use of heater or defogger significantly lowers the overall battery range of miles available!!
I don't love that the low beam headlights are blue to begin with, but the high beam headlights are just too wimpy on a dark road.
I just use my iPhone, because it's so much simpler, but i expected to see the nav screen coupled with the iPhone. Nope
Since it is an electric, it seems to run thru a cycle, then stops blowing/defrosting if I'm out shoveling the driveway. I have to go over and turn the system back on and restart the process. I believe that if I leave the key fob in the car it alleviates the problem, but not sure. been a while.
In curves and turns, the vehicle is a bit back-end heavy and wants to oversteer. The turning is controllable yet takes some getting used to.
The interior switch was responsive less than 50% of the time. The key fob button did operation the convertible top yet required disengaging the engine to operate from the key fob. The issue was resolved in the second service appointment for the same issue.
Parking sensors went offline and had to be reprogrammed
: Navigation system has rebooted a few times unprompted, but has come back online immediately.
Nail caused the tire to require replacement.
Door sensor didn't detect closure sensor, fixed by BMW dealership.
: Tire pressure sensor indicated low pressure, but upon checking pressure was okay
I listen to books on my iPhone and the Bluetooth connection disconnects at times without warning.
When I leave everyday for work, I have several bags/briefcases over my right shoulder & key in my bag.  The driver's lock automatically opens w touch, but then I have to lean in all the way to center of console to open back door to put my bags in.  I often can't reach b/c of shoulder bags, have to put them on ground just to reach to  unlock back door, then put on back seat.  I went into auto-manual & tried to re-program lock control, but couldn't. Would prefer ALL doors unlock when open w keyless.
Minimal warmth. Always turning off & on to see if it says activated or deactivated.  Previous BMW had much better warmth. ,I was really happy this car had this option.) Can this be made warmer??
: Really don't know if this is a problem, b/c I only tried once, but Nav system indicated I could 'speak' the address I needed, but that did not work.  I meant to try it again, or look in to it, but have not.
very heavy, alot heavier than the 650 sedan trunk of our other car.
A soft top convertible is noisier than a hard top.
sound proofing not very effective
: The plastic piece that removes to reveal the manual key hole on the drivers door has always been lose. I push it back into place every other day, hopefully it can be adjust next time I visit the dealer. ;-)
Every time the car is in reverse, the side mirrors tilt down for curb view. The passenger side returns to normal, but I cannot figure out how to get the driver side to return the memory 1 position without manually adjusting it by the 4-way control.
System voice  isn't very clear.
Cumbersome to enter addresses. Also wish I could select a different voice.
Hard to reach without lifting the center armrest.
Light colored seats, need cleaning almost weekly.
I have several BMW's and I always have a hard time figuring out the wiper washer controls
Difficult to manuever
Clunky interface when trying to set radio stations.
Takes forever to enter an address.  I use my iPhone instead.
Chemical smell from the faux leather seats, worst when parked in the sun.  Slowly going away after 3 months.
hard to describe but closest I could provide is that it smelled like a stale meat
My dealership open up a case with BMW engineering to see if they could correct the problem. THey ordered a new antenna and waiting to replace.  The problem only occurs when I'm on my bluetooth using my phone. Constant static. I have an iphone and we tried with samsung. I also have ATT and we tried with Verizon. It appears to be an issue with apple play.The problem is with the car. I also sometimes have issues when trying to use spotify in that it doesn't pair.  I had worse pairing issues with my 2014 BMW 335i. I was told then that the problem was with Apple not updating their IOS with BMW but I'm in technology and don't buy it. THere is something seriously wrong with how the bluetooth operates in BMW.  At two different dealerships I was told that they have never had a complaint with the bluetooth.
Please see previous comment
Got a letter from BMW stating there was a recall - taking it for repair after Easter because I need a loaner car
I was noticing that my MPG is NOT EVEN CLOSE to advertised and now it goes from 8 MPG to 99 MPG every few seconds. Taking it in for a recall  and service after Easter.
: The start stop works every so often without warning - i plan on asking about this when I take it in for service.
Difficult to get one-push exterior release to auto open trunk, usually end up opening 1/3 of the way when the trunk release is pushed.
WHEN CAR IS PARKED AT NIGHT, AND ITS COLD OUTSIDE, THE WINDOWS ENDS UP FOGGED AND IT TAKES SOME TIME BEFORE THIS CLEARS UP ESPECIALLY IN THE REAR WINDSHIELD.
Having issues with phone call connectivity...sometimes the connection is static or has a buzzing/scratching noise .
Traffic doesnt work
had a flat tire within 24 hours of receiving the car.
Sounds like the inside is creaking; like twisted metal
Hit both
Hard to understand what the button does
Believe it is due to the run flat low profile tires.
Some times they do not work.  Oftentimes it's when I use my turn indicator to change lanes
I say an address in California and it sends me to Canada or New York.
Mainly when the AC is on driving on hwy
dust or dirt appears to be under clear coat.  Surprisingly for factory paint.
If you start the car with a foot on the clutch but no foot on the brake, the car rolls even though the parking brake is engaged.
The placement of the gauges and the steering wheel is poor, because the gauges are too low to be seen over the steering wheel.
When I have things plugged into the cigarette lighter, such as a radar detector, when you bump it slightly, it shuts off, so the lighter must be loose. I have verified my equipment does not experience this issue in other vehicles.
Sometimes the bluetooth doesn't automatically connect, and frequently it will not display song/artist information, so the next/previous song controls do not work, and you have to manually change the song on the phone.
When closing the sun visor, sometimes it pops out of place and you have to snap it back in to close it properly. It also hardly blocks the sun because it is too short.
Still trying to understand how auto and intermittent work. They are confusing, even after reading the manual.
Fitted a bit too tightly in its sleeve, so requires a good tug to extend and retract
The foot release for the trunk is hard to locate the right spot.  I gave up and just use either the inside release or the key fob.
The engine seems to run very rough for the first 10 minutes or so.  I asked the dealer about it.  He said it was normal.
No one told me the back seats folded down.  My girlfriend who had the same model told me.  I haven't tried it yet.
I had trouble changing the position of the seat for driver 1 and 2.  It is not easy to change.  Usually you just hold the memory button and it resets itself.  It doesn't do that in this car - or I am doing it wrong.
: I don't think all the vents have air coming out of them.
The USB and aux jack are located in the center armrest which needs to be opened to get to.
Minor chip in paint.    Did not see it when I took delivery.
A/c velocity in one vent is not consistent with the others. : A/C not cooling as well as it should.
Took car to BMW of San Francisco and they fixed the problem and it hasn't returned. Loose pane behind glove compartment.
Bulge in door panel for Water Bottle hits leg when foot is on dead pedal
door handle feels like it is locked even when in the unlocked position
I have to pair the phone almost every time I get into it.
Driving long distances the seat becomes uncombortable. Seems as though the bottom of the seat should adjust further to a more comfortable configuration that just doesn't seem available. It's in the design of the seat, not a problem that can be corrected.
Too complicated to use. I need on/off and speed adjustments. It's either too much air or not enough air. System is too sophisticated for this unsophisticated driver
operation of the HVAC is difficult to understand
surface of rear glass has a grid patter on the surface of the glass which looks poor but does not affect driving performance.
Maybe it wasn't explained but more difficult than the Audi I had before.
On a recent trip I wanted to stay on a toll road but the navigation system kept trying to move me . : Been to see the Genius numerous times as the electronic system is very complicated.
I have not been able to find out how to use these, but also have not asked the dealer.
We've had a couple situations when the trunk hasn't opened or closed for a couple tries then after a moment will function properly. 2 maybe 3 times in two months
The engine at times sounds noisy and off for a BMW. We were worried about the condition of the engine. When we asked at dealership we were told they could sound that way at first and would get better. I think I notice it less now because I am use to it.
it is a small issue that usually corrects itself
The doors require two pulls on the door handle to open. To remedy this requires turning off the auto lock system.
The 'foot wave' feature rarely responds.
Intermittent function needs constant adjusting, often wiping dry windows at high speed when set at low intermittent speed.
Preset function very complicated to use. Presets have disappeared three times and often change the preferred order, i.e. news stations, music genres were intentionally grouped together but often appear in random order in the presets only to return as set several days later.
Routes incorrectly, complicated system to use.
Routes incorrectly but then without making any change to the entered address, will then direct correctly.
Car seems underpowered. Gas mileage suffers because of this.
: A/C system did not operate.  Didn't notice it at first because we took delivery during a cool month.  One day it was warmer than normal, and we found out the A/C wasn't working.  A part had to be ordered from Germany, and we were without our car for 10 days.  The dealership provided a loaner vehicle, including switching us into a larger one when we needed it for the extra luggage space that our X3 had over the 3-series car we were given.  We believe the dealership did whatever they could to assist us, but we were unhappy that our brand-new $50K vehicle spent 10 days in the shop.
Indicator warning came on soon after car was purchased and took many minutes to read book and understand how to resolve the low pressure issue.
The standard locks are a pain. The ability to open and lock doors with Fob in my pocket should be standard on a mini, not an added feature that ridiculously was not included in my Cooper S convertible. Very inconvenient and needless annoyance.
: Radio occasionally shuts off while driving and Pandora logo appears. Hush Pandora would just go away. Radio occasional goes off while driving and I am prompted to hit the Connect button again.
: Multiple scratches on driver side window. Two large scratches on front window shield.
They squeak sometimes when it's wet out initially after I start the car.  No big deal...
The apple car play is screwy, sometimes it's difficult to switch back to the radio or vice versa.
The voice recognition does not understand what I am saying whether driving or at a stop and it frequently changes the state input in the navigation system. I don't use voice command anymore for navigation. I also have issues when trying to use it with my phone.
Its hard to adjust seat
It would be nice if the seatbelt height could adjust. It is a little on the higher end and it rubs on my collar bone.
The cup holder is too small for one of my water bottles I use. For the smaller one that will fit, the holder is too close to the center console while makes it frustrating to put in and out of the holder. The holder is also really stiff so getting bottles in and out is not easy. Takes some wiggling which also increases the chance of spilling.
Putting into reverse is very stiff, hard to go into easily. On some occasions it is difficult to go into 1st gear, not always.
The system would be more efficient with greater control or more variable speed settings for the windshield wipers. And, a less complicated way of activating it and the rear wipers would be welcome. This set up has been way too overthought.
Akward to put things in/out due to convertiblel mechanism.  Slow to open, i.e. can't pop the trunk - have to open by hand after releasing lock.
Smells like fish.
It uses a lot of gas compared to my previous vehicle, an Acura 2.3 CL.
If I stop for a drink at a drive thru, it is difficult to get the cup into and out of the cup holder. It seems that the cup holders need to be moved about an inch closer to the gear shift to be able to comfortably access a cup.
: Bluetooth connection does not reconnect easily. Large delay between phone control and audio output, artist artwork and song title are stuck on first song in display.
When starting the car and putting it in drive, it often takes 10-20 seconds before the gear will engage...
When I want the car to cruise slowly through a parking lot, it awkwardly downshifts to a crawl.  Often times this happens in parking garages and forces a jolt forward and for me to hit the gas again.
Misinterrupts voice
I am tall and have long arms, but I can't reach the glove box.
With the glove box hard to reach, the center console storage barely has any room to put things in and it is the only storage space.  I'm not counting the cup holders as storage space.
The sun visor doesn't extend the length of the driver window when moved to the side window.
Playing music from my device through bluetooth doesn't always work. The vehicle may recognize the phone so I can make phone calls but the pandora app and the option to select music from my phone doesn't always appear. Sometimes if I wait a minute or two before a leave a parking spot these apps will appear.
The floor mat attaches by a velcro disc. The disc is inserted into a slit in the floor of the car. On the first day I noticed that the disc isn't securely fastened to the car. Therefore the floor mat wouldn't be securely fastened. I figured out later that the disc needed to be locked in place with a screwdriver. This shouldn't have been an issue a new car.
This is perhaps due to me still learning about the car and not pressing buttons correctly.
I say one thing it does another thing.
It paired at the dealership but doesnt automatically pair when I get in the vehicle and does not sync the new information I have entered in my phone.
Voice spoken address is inaccurately typed. I end up having to use the dial by letter method which is time consuming. The voice nav was THE very reason I wanted the tech system in the first place so it IS very frustrating to have this not work.
I say driver seat because I drive alone 99% of the time.
to my knowledge there is no height adjustment and i wish it did
windshield appears blemished in afternoon sunlight
engine hesitates when trying accelerate, engine also has oil leak which i consider pathetic in this day
: the transmission has popped out of gear twice in reverse while backing out of a level garage, pathetic
It was tape residue. They detailed car & fixed it right away.
the lever is very far back and hard to reach
control in an odd spot--not easy to get to and adjust
Not sure what it is--just noticed it. Might be a loose screw b/c I removed instrument panel for after market mobile phone clip
Should be using ceramic pads this day and age.
During and mostly after a turn there is a short proper gear seeking hesitation, normal mode only, not evident in eco or sport mode.
When going over a large bump near our house, there is a loud 'CLUNCK' sound from the front suspension
Very hard to reach buckle into lock.  Too low beneath seat height
This is related to the fact that the car has the split rear doors, which I knew when buying the car.  It's just harder to open and close 2 doors, in the correct order, compared with a traditional hatchback.  But it looks cool!
Finding the lever was somewhat difficult for me, but it's fine now that I know where it is.
It's buried in a bunch of other controls and it's hard for me to find it when I need it.
: The automatic/manuel/outside air intake doesn't stay on the desired setting. After a few minutes of the desired setting is set it goes back to automatic.
I feel that the location of the cup holder is too close to the other control panel which is inconvenient due to mistake pressing other buttons by mistake.
At a full stop waiting on the stop light foot is on the brake ""automatic engine shut down/restart/re-engagement"" is on. Shortly after the engine came back on when not yet in motion. Other word foot is not yet off the brake and the ""automatic engine shut down/restart/re-engagement"" came back on.
Noticed a problem when the engine light came on indicating that more oil needed to be added and fresh oil drips in the garage where the vehicle was park.
The problem arises during the engine oil problem
Noticed a fresh oil stain in the garage where the vehicle was park.
Won't pair with Pandora
Too difficult to find next turn directions. When using WAZE, you can select a dropdown list of the turn by turn directions with one click.
Some minor squeaking on days below 40 deg F only at very slow speeds when coming to a stop. Occurs even after car and brakes have warmed up.
i have to hold steering wheel slightly left-of-center in order to drive straight on a straight road
brakes sometimes squeal when braking, does not affect stopping distance
For some reason, BMW turn signals continue to work differently from 99% of all other vehicle turn signals in that they don't ""click to turn on, on unclick to turn off""...they require an unintuitive ""almost click"" to turn off, which results in a lot of signalling mistakes
rubber trim where top of window meets door is slightly misaligned/deformed
intermittent rattle heard near center console, cannot find source
Information provided in my answer selection above.
When the fan is on it is loud at all speeds.
I took my car in for this situation and the technician or mechanic said that this is normal.
This comment is about the ""no touch"" comfort access function for the tailgate where you waive your foot under the car to open or close the hatch. It is entirely unpredictable. I almost never seem to be able to get it to work to open the tailgate, but have had it activate and try and close the tailgate on me while I am loading items into the car. They should get rid of it.
The clips that hold the cover at the bottom bend down easily and that makes it impossible to latch the cover. You often need to bend the clip back and then latch the cover.
At times when engaging the engine to drive and excelling with the gas, engine does not shift to appropriate gear causing a rough ride and transition between gears
It's hard to understand how to get the air to just come out of the vents, they seem to keep coming out of the vents by the windshield now matter what setting they are on
Intermittent ""No Signal"" message from satellite radio. Switching audio source and retuning to satellite radio seems to resolve the issue.
: subtle vibration when accelerating at about 1400 rpm
happens around 1400 rpm, plan to tell dealer at first service
The door is just hard to move around
Phone and bluetooth audio seem to be slowing one another down when both are on.
tires on 1 side over-inflated, causing alingment to be off
: Car has occasional mobile device connectivity issues
I wish more locations to vent evenly on the rear.
Time did not adjust for daylight savings. Had to manually change time.
: AUX connection did not seem to transmit anything from mobile devices with aux cable. Took it in to dealer, BMW genius was unable to resolve.
: The problem I experienced listed above was the power jack in the center console does not work. I have yet to bring the vehicle to the dealer as it is not a big problem
When I get out of the car and go around to the passenger side the door isn't unlocked. I have to remember to hit the unlock button before I go around to the other door.
: Head-up display is difficult to read when wearing polarized sunglasses.
The vehicle has Apple CarPlay as well as standard Bluetooth pairing. It seems to get confused and fail to connect with CarPlay, falling back to Bluetooth only. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
doesn't always work even when the key is right next to car
just is hard to get to cool fast and maintain a certain temp
The twisting of the tip of the control arm engages the rear wipers. This is not intuitive. The depressing of the tip of the control arm engages the intermittent front wiper. This too is not intuitive. The options for the pace of the front intermittent wiper at the lowest setting is too fast. The rain sensor behind the rear view mirror cannot correctly compensate for the amount of rain.
hidden in sub-menus of the navigation system
Off Button too small. Off Button in poor location. Fan speed control button too small.
too small. awkwardly shaped, even for the owners manual to be placed inside.
: When using Satellite radio the lowest volume setting is still quite loud.
switch is below steering wheel on column, light is impossible to see
AMradio is disabled by software, dealer is working on fixing the problem
voice recognition does not understand me . A German car should speak German with me! It only has options for English, French, Spanish...no German
often does not pair with my iphone 7, have to maually pair it
system uses routes that take much longer, eg instead of going one mile straight in main route to shopping center, it told me to take entrance to highway to next town and drive ca four miles through town to same shopping center! Weird!
Even lowest fan setting blows too much cold air, heat takes a long time to warm up car, especially when driving with the electric motor. Very uncomfortable to have a lot of cold air blown at driver! I turn heat off and use heated seat only. Very cold in winter. Really a big problem with this new car! Heat gets warm fast when drivng with gas motor.
temperature varies depending on which motor is drivng the car, electric or gas. No stable comfortable temp.
I do not like it that engine constantly shuts off, even when it has not warmed up yet. I think that is very bad for the engine
the noisy sounds like a butterfly rattling its wing
harmful to people's health
Could be user error, but I have a hard time getting the hatch to open at times.
The leather pulled away from the rear seat folding latch.
I have no idea how to use this
could not get hit to work at dealership in Las Vegas
it his poorly designed nothing to explain
difficult to use
Cant turn of navigation stereo controls a rolling knob instead of button and would be better on left side very difficult to pair phone
Since the seats are white they get stained easily.
Radio reception is just not clear in rural areas.
Not intuitive. While driving you can't be looking at the controls. hard to stop the wipers once on. have to try up and down a few times before they stop.
While driving I turn the signal on to merge into a lane, then try to stop the signal , but it doesn't stop it just  turns on the signal in the opposite direction. Not intuitive. While driving you can't be looking at the controls.
it is not a touch screen.... you have to use the dial to scroll through choices on the system. Takes too long and isn't easy to use.  I never use it, instead I use google maps on my phone.
Must slam the rear doors hard. If not, the door open fault light will be lit on the display.
The door seal on the driver side rear door was falling off so I re-installed it.
Searching for businesses results in business not found. I quickly search using my phone and the business is found. This has happened on nearly every place I search for. The database is just missing most places . I try to search by address, keyword, name, still no luck. Pop out the phone and I find the place in seconds and start navigating.
After releasing seat belt buckle and returning belt to get out of the vehicle, the buckle falls all the way to the bottom of the belt. This makes it hard to reach when you are putting the seat belt back on.
The glove box when closed has an uneven gap in relation to the dash. You can push it down with your hand and the gap will be even but, when you release the pressure of your hand, the gap will be uneven once again.
I feel like I am braking through a mattress when I have to stop abruptly. The brakes are awful.
TOO MANY SAFETY VALIDATIONS... CAR OFF OR MUST BE IN PARK, ETC. AND SOMEHOW WE END UP HAVING TO USE KEY FOB.
HAVE TO CALL TO MAKE APPOINTMENT... NOT VERY CONVENIENT.
Unable to make this functionality work until now. : One of the front sensor is not working as expected. It sounds as if there is an object closer to it, even there isn't one closer to it.
: Noise interference while making calls via Apple Play or Bluetooth, so cannot continue speaking on phone, I have to disconnect phone and have to make the call again. It happens 2 out of 10 times.
This is a design issue, the rear hung doors are great when there is room around the opening area, but when it is tight they are very inconvenient
Opening the frank secondary latch is inconvenient
noice comes from around the sun roof
When I stop at slow speeds they make a groaning noise.
Has connectivity issues.
Just a clicking sound when I go over bumps.
Once I hit the button on the truck to open it, it opens a little  usually and I have to open it up fully myself. The trunk/hatch door is heavy.
The gauge/instrument panel is not illuminated during the day, often making it difficult to see. This is a design fault that should be corrected.
Must 'feel' for button on steering column. Not visible while driving
: No engine problems! Exhaust noise under engine, and middle of the car.
The window tinting had separation, which looked like bubbles.
Not easy to understand function buttons
Very confused on how to set favorite channels. Overall touch screen and navi is very complicated to understand.
Navi and touch screen is overall very complicated and not user friendly.
Hard to tell where direction of passenger side vent. Is the button set to blo to face or feet? Button looks different from driver side button.
I hear you engine sound that sound like pistols moving. It's not loud but it bothers me because I have not heard noise like this with other cars before. I usually hear this sound when I'm at stop light.
Slow leak in tire.
If I scuff the doors when getting out of the car , then they should be easy to clean or remove. I have not been excessively rough in getting out of the car, just brushing my shoe against the door panel causes a scuff which is almost impossible to remove.
: LIGHTS ON DASHBOARD ARE NOT WORKING
Feels like a lot of force is needed to close the hood, worries I may break the hood every time I close it.
I think BMW ripped out the sound deadening
Lack of sound deadoning
Big brakes kinda expect them to have a lot of dust but more then standard cars
Sounds like the suspension bottoms out once in a while under normal city driving
Bluetooth has issue connecting media music sometimes when the phone is also plugged in via USB it doesn't automatically switch like it's supposed to. Sometime I have to tell the car to reconnect to the iPhone in the Bluetooth settings to get the music I want to play. Also pandora launches randomly over Spotify which is the service I typically use for music.
wouldn't hold air, couldn't find leak
The iDrive system is terrible to use. The radio should not be part of this system. This system should not exist. I would like a standard radio with standard control. In 30 years of driving I have never needed to pull over to safely use any part of my radio. Everything could be down by feel without taking my eyes off the road.
Plugging a cell phone charger in the cigarette lighter makes it hard to use the cup holders.
In my 2008 BMW 328i, I was able to see the track tags on the radio and I was able to change songs from the steering wheel controls. With this new BMW, I can do neither function. Why was this removed? Also, the radio control functions in the steering wheel are less user friendly than the 2008 BMW
Brakes excessively sensitive, hard to stop without jerking
when coming to a stop, unless car is completely stopped, the car transmission does not shift to first gear
clock on dash in hidden location clock on monitor display small. Would be nice to see date as well.
Rear fan is weak - not equal to front fan. Setting ""auto"" does not maintain temp -- too cold or too warm Have to adjust manually 
When audio is on, vibration/noise is present
No room for anything much. Door storage is insufficient space as well. Plus: Where to put the key fob? I guess women have in their purse, but it is too large for pants pocket. Need a slot or hanger for this item!
Smell seems to be from seats . Seems to be subsiding after 2 months
The car is too noisy on the freeway. it is build with too little sound insulation. and ride quality is pretty bad : Tire noise is way too loud for the car. It feel like a track car or race car
steering pulls left and right excessively on uneven road condition
The brake dust on the wheel is a lot just driving for a few days
there is no P selector on the gearbox. Hand brake do play an important part when you are parking on a slope. The hand brake is not adjustable and you have pull it up high to make the car stop on a small slope. Dealer said there is no way to adjust the had brake as it is self adjusting
The tire track is way too big that's why the steering do pulls left and right in uneven surface on the freeway or even at low speed
the car steering is way too heavy even in comfort mode. BMW need to make the steering lighter. It is just way too heavy
rattle coming from the back under hard acceleration
It rattle under hard acceleration.
There is no P selector on the gear. Stopping on an incline is a challenge as it will only turn to P when the gear is on D or R and turning the ignition off.
Continuation of a problem that has plagued 2-door MINI models for some time. Placement of retracted seat belt  and latch are a bit better on this 2017 model than it was on our 2014 model, but is still a bit difficult. Unfortunately, it's a design issue so there's nothing that dealer can do to correct. MINI does make an attachment for the headrest that is intended to better locate the retracted seat belt; however, it is poorly designed and neither functions very well nor lasts very long before breaking. We've gone through two sets and had to return both for credit.
Probably due to low profile run flat tires & stiff suspension : Road noise
Door locking unlocking choice reverts back to separate clicks for driver vs 3 passenger doors. Want them to all unlock with one click
Seems too technical / too many steps
It's just difficult to get the seat ""right"" and if someone else drives the car and changes it, to get to back to where I had it ""just right"".
It's just difficult to get the control to get the seat ""right"" and then if someone else drives the car to get it back to where I had it. It's challenging to reach the proper/comfortable lumbar seat position.
Several passengers have complained that they have difficulty buckling/getting to the seal belt buckle.
It works just fine but because I'm used to having a hand break  it's strange for in the snow and I feel limited in what I can do for control in that situation.
When the car comes to a stop, is turned off and then the drivers side door unlocks, all other doors should also unlock. Especially with the key less entry because if your bag is in the trunk and you get out of the car and go to the trunk, it will not unlock until you go back to the drivers side door and manually unlock the doors - very frustrating.
There isn't a spot to see the turn by turn navigation in addition to the map at the same time.
: THE CAR HAS A NIFTY DESIGN WHICH UNLESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT HAS A FLAW. IT IS A CONVERTIBLE AND SINCE THE BONNET IS SO SMALL WITH NOT MUCH OF A VERTICAL OPENING IT IS POSSIBLE TO UNLATCH WHERE THE ROOF CONNECTS TO THE BODY AT THE TOP OF THE BONNET OR TRUNK DOOR. THIS BRILLIANTLY ALLOWS YOU TO LIFT THE SECTION OF ROOF UP WHICH HAS THE BACK WINDOW IN IT TO ALLOW FOR MORE VERTICAL ACCESS TO THE BONNET. WHAT IS NOT SO BRILLIANT IS THERE IS NO WAY TO HOOK THAT TO SOMETHING SO THAT IT STAYS UP WHILE ONE IS TRYING TO INSERT SOMETHING INTO THE BONNET SO YOU HAVE TO HOLD IT UP WITH ONE HAND WHILE TRYING TO INSERT SOMETHING IN THE TRUNK WITH THE OTHER HAND WHICH IS AWKWARD ... SO EXCELLENT IDEA BUT NOT THOUGHT THROUGH ENOUGH.
This problem seems to occur with most voice commands as I have had the same problems with previous cars. I choose to use 'phone book' instead.
Terrible. Due to driving a Mini, I am now among those idiots who drives down the expressway with my turn signal blinking even though I am not indicating a turn. This is actually a safety hazard that I wish Mini would seriously address. Please just make the turn signal turn on and off more securely without extra features that get in the way of the most basic function. Most other cars in the civilized world do this. The turn signals on the Mini Cooper work just like all the gadgets on a toilet in a Chinese hotel. They are needlessly complex and get in the way of their basic function. If I have to take this to the dealer wouldn't you think there is some kind of problem with the design?
I set the clock for my location  and the time is incorrect. maybe this has not been programmed to understand daylight savings time. too complicated. Why should anybody have to take their car to the dealer to program the clock???
Just make it easy to turn on and off. The question about ""have you taken this problem to a dealer"" does not apply. Why should the interface for a radio be so complicated that it requires interpretation and training?
If my iPhone 6 is not attached to the bluetooth system, it works just fine. For example, when attached, Siri doesn't work very well, everything else slows down and really, I hesitate to even bother connecting when everything works so much better. Same with Maps and navigation apps.
sometimes you just want to turn on the defroster; not max speed. would be nice to be able to do this.
Occurs very randomly  every couple of weeks and almost sounds like a small pebble is hitting the hood/roof. If it weren't so regular, I would think it is a pebble hitting the roof or hood or something. Trying to pay attention to see if there is a pattern with the weather or anything else. Not a big deal at all but thought I would mention it since you asked :)
fitting from oil line to turbo failed causing oil to leak all over the engine. after much negotiation, the dealer agreed to take the vehicle back and we bought another.
Unable to move the heads up display to the right or left - just goes up and down. Since the upward adjustment of the seat height is limited sometimes the heads up display be distracting. Discussed with the dealer at the encore visit and there is nothing that can be done. This is a set feature
When naming a place, recognition system will start making a phone call.
The sound isn't actually a squeak - it is something metal rolling back and forth when going around curves.  It lasts for about 2 seconds, and sounds like a ball bearing in a metal tray.
Front passenger door takes more effort to close than driver side door. Have to close the door harder to ensure it closes.
Cap that covers tow point does not fit properly. Dealership reinstalled it but it came off again the same day.
Its less of an issue or mechanical problem than a noticable stop or start to the engine.
Does not recognize names and comes up with strange alternatives.
: IPHONE 7 and BLUE Tooth functionality when paired has a buzzing noise when talking on the phone: Blue tooth IPHONE 7 has a buzzing noise from time to time in the car
The problem appears to have resolved itself.  I may have caused the problem by inadvertently turning on the A/C while the heater was on.
Gets 15/23 mpg.  Rating sheet states 18/25 mpg for 535xi gt.  Only 1500 miles on car and have x drive.  Wife's 335i  gets 22/35 mpg.
The problem has come and gone.  Can't be replicated in the shop.
What are you expected to put on it without it getting tossed out when you make a sharp turn?  It should be deeper.
At a stop the RPM gauge sometimes dips below 1 and the engine shakes as if it's going to stall out.  It's happened twice thus far.
Does not always understand request for driving directions
It does not reliably pick a spot to park
disconnects from Bluetooth randomly
Initially I was very confused how to even open the fuel door. Most cars either have an interior button that does this or it's manually pulled open. I used google to figure out that the vehicle had to be unlocked to open and close latch. This is one of my biggest complaints about this vehicle. This is a huge safety concern, as people must leave their vehicle and items  vulnerable to potential misconduct. I dislike refueling my car for this very reason.
Occasionally connects automatically other times I have to 'Forget Device' then reconnect iPhone for it to work. When I open certain apps, my car will automatically open a completely separate app  instead. That is quite frustrating.
There is a slight rattle in either the front passenger side door or the overhead roof liner directly above it.  Audible at normal driving speeds.
See previous comment.
: Problem with saved radio stations disappearing
Sometimes the driver's door does not unlock without using my key manually.  Same holds true for the hatchback door.
It's hard to UNLOcK with your foot.  Sometimes it does and sometimes not.
Twice I have contents of mugs to spill on floor when making a turn.
Power tailgate sometimes does not open all of the way on cold days.
Some audio system controls are in center console, which is not where they are expected to be. FM and AM memory seems to be combined in one set of buttons instead of separate bands.
It seems like the automatic opening tailgate does not always work when you kick underneath the vehicle.
have to move leg several times to get it to open
bluetooth connection drops in middle of call, phone defaults to headset. Happens occasionally
could be closer to center console
: Factory installed speakers are not that great, very poor audio, it is not branded. for a vehicle that is priced so high, a good branded speakers should have been installed.
Moving from parking to reverse is hard and moving back from rive to parking , it becomes hard while crossing reverse
I spoke with BMW Genius who said Apple phones have a software glitch that shuts off the radio when searching to connect to Bluetooth.
: The adaptive cruse control often shuts off, sometimes when in bright direct sunlight, but sometimes for no apparent reason. It is not possible to turn it back on for an extended period of time. It also sometimes sees overpasses as a car and breaks hard and sometimes sees large trucks in the right lane as being in my lane.
Screen is too small, no way to scroll to see upcoming traffic or routes.
I find myself constantly adjusting the temperature to maintain comfortable heating in the car. Also on AUTO, the foot and leg area do not warm sufficiently.
as I said before, needs time to recognize something is connected thru USB port. In my previous X3 USB port worked great. No issues. : USB port, every time I turn the car on USB port needs some time  to recognize something is plug there
Memory doesn't seem consistent. Sometimes it moves with different drivers, sometimes not. Confusing.
you have to tilt the cup to get it to fit in the cup holder and the holder is so deep you need to lift from the very top of the cup, which creates easy spills
Screen does not adjust to height desired in rear.
I haven't had LED lights in the past, but thinking if the BMW came standard with LED the lights would have been brighter.
Noise can be heard when very windy out - as if window seals are not 100% sealed.  Not really a problem, but more of an observation.
color from jeans rubs off on material.  And easily gets fingerprints on door handles.  I did get simonize protection and will plan to take to dealer for service at some point.
Navigation sometime does not recognize spoken word. It happens once in a while.
Pairing the I-pad is tricky
The leather has marks/imperfections on it.
Need to have more than1 portal for devices also if I'm using aux and plug in to charging device it automatically changes to blue tooth when I want to keep using aux for my nano
Doesn't recognize or misinterprets voice commands all the time also does not give enough options with addresses
Driver leather seat stains from my jeans the driver seat is dis colored
Seat will not move forward or backward using control.
I have noticed the creak recently. I purchased this vehicle Nov 18  2016. 
Minimal sound from rear speakers, requires service call to correct.
Could not see green light to know when they were on or off.
They side window vents do not provode enough air movement if the center vents are not restricted.  In the deep south it is a problem with high heat and high humidity.
It's a rattle, like something is slightly loose in door
Very counterintuitive turn signal as it always returns to 'neutral'. It can either be too brief or it can stay on even after changing a lane for instance and be potentially confusing/dangerous.
Camera does not turn on usually at first start in the morning.
not sure how it works
Driver belt tells me not lock , when it is.
Sometimes tells you to turn down one way streets that are not favorable
I have short legs and when I avoid using the narrow side step I have  to be careful not to hit my shin on it. On my driving experience pick up of my car I hit my shin and it bled.
: The Apple Play has had multiple issues. In addition the car was delivered making a clicking noise. After taking the car to service several times within the first few weeks the problem was discovered. A plastic piece that is part of the front window defrost system melted and was popping when heated. The issue took over a week to resolve once diagnosed.

I have one speaker in the passenger side door that rattles and vibrates.  I have not yet sought service, but will do so.  I am confident that it will be repaired.
Gas pedal feels ackward, not a good fit
: Music stored on hard drive doesn't play as loud as satellite radio or cds.  In some instances i have to turn the volume up a lot louder.  Better quality in my opinion 2011 BMW X3.  Preferred that vehicle a lot better than 2017 model
Recently was trying to find Pensey Spice Company in Naperville, IL.  Voice command didnt under name of business,  was very difdicult to manually enter in location.  System giving wrong direction
Automatic/ fast/ slow settings are not clear. Owner's manual is not helpful with this issue.
speaker quality for hearing spoken voice is not good despite adjustments made to bass/ treble and speaker location
I am still having difficulty understanding the memory function and at times have to readjust position even though my driver profile seems to be set up.
Having to set temp to red or blue for heat or cooling seems a redundant step when temp has been set, but seems I do not get the desired temp without that step I have spoken to Genius as I am 200 miles from the dealer in answer to next question
I and O are not standard symbols....O for Off or On or Open?? I for In or Off or On...
Seems very loud and forceful. Turning fan down seems to shut off auto function.  Have not had to use defrost as yet, so may be an issue with this as well. Do not yet know.
Just very small
To left of steering column. Very small.
Rock hit windshield and broke it.  Had windshield replaced and a week later another rock from vehicle driving in front of me hit windshield and it cracked the new windshield.  Another stone hit on other side of windshield and left a small knick in the glass - This is the 5th car I've owned and I've never had a windshield crack or replaced - within 2 months of owning this vehicle it seems crazy to have 2 broken windshields from pebbles coming off of trucks and hitting it.
Right side wiper leaves entire side of the windshield streaked
Too hot.  Can't find comfortable temperature.  Center console/cup holders get very warm when heat is on - warm enough to heat up a bottle of water in cup holder.
Pairing problems with the iphone.  Apple Carplay work intermittently and often won't connect.
happened 3 times on my first 2016 x5m before they lemon lawed the car they traded it in for a new 2017 and with less than 2000 miles the noise has appeared on my new 120k dollar vehicle.  unbelievable!
can't control system front front of car for kids in rear seat.  have to get out of car to use remote control.  absolutely stupid!
IF you open the pullout drawer and forget to close it before you get our, your going to bash your knee right into the corner of it.  Or visa versa if you open it and then get into the car, you will bash your knee into it.  Overall, just a bad location.  Should of been an open shelf with no pull out drawer.
Sunglass have to be wire framed or very small reading glasses.  You can not put a pair of Oakley Sunglasses in it.
Per previous mention, when we first leased the automobile we were erroneously given an error that the seat restrain system was 'malfunctioning.' : Whenever an individual sat in the passenger seat, we received a warning that the 'restraint system' was malfunctioning. It would alert us repeatedly with a chime - making it impossible to drive with a passenger.
The 'dual system' dials are easy enough to understand - but there is an additional manual 'analog' dial with blue/red temperature markers on the dash in between the vents. It is unclear what this is for or how it relates to the main controls.
The AC seems to make too much noise for such an expensive/luxury vehicle.
the tire pressure monitor says the tires are not within range, tires seem fine
wipers hard to manuever, cant seem to get it in middle its either fast or slow.
indicator light tells us to check manual for tire pressure gauge, we used the automatic tire pressure check and the indicator light still shows, not sure if we need to take to dealer
blue tooth doesnt detect my phone, the bluetooth has the car but, car does not and we cant connect properly
heating system so hard to understand you put it at a certain temperature and it just heats up too fast and only way to adjust is to lower the fan
They are hard to reach unless you have long arms
appears car was damaged during transport; dings were in bumper and bumper was replaced.
strange intermittent squealing/grinding sound from rear axle.  happens occasionally and lasts only a second or so but seems to happen sporadically but consistently.
Door seal is so tight against the door jam that the door has to be slammed shut
Exterior weatherstripping squeaks against the door jam incessantly. Apparently this is a known service issue. The dealership is going to install material on the door jam where the seal touches that is supposed to prevent the squeaking from happening.
The brakes are an upgrade called the 'M-sport performance brake kit.' They are a fixed-caliper design, which is known to squeal when the brakes are cold.
It sounds like the plastic is 'settling in'
Wipers cannot be set on Auto all the time.  Instead the auto button must be engaged each time by pushing button.  Should be defaulted to auto and then turn off manually.
Very hard to tell exactly how much collision avoidance the vehicle has.  Does it stop/brake for you?  The alert should be audible not just visual in the heads up display.  The idea of collision avoidance is to alert me as the driver and this system relies upon me having complete focus on the heads up display.  In reality this isn't always the case when driving with other distractions.  Would be great if vehicle would issue audible alert when the traffic ahead is slowing.
All apply to adjusting second row seat.  Very difficult to get into place and move.
all controls for temperature adjustment are very small and it can be difficult to see them clearly especially while driving and trying to also pay attention to the road.  Additionally, the direction arrows indicating airflow from vents  is VERY small and almost impossible to see well or adjust while driving.  Placing the fan on full speed also does not seem to blow significant air.
if i keep my finger on the release button for more than Three or Five second it won't open all the way
seat seams are too thick / bold and hurt my legs : the seats have a thick exposed seam  where the stitches come together and it really hurts my legs
: It gave me a warning saying that the engine was operating at a limited power
Sometimes it connects automatically/easily and sometimes it doesn't.
The parking system does a poor job of recognizing available spaces.  I have never had it accurately recognize a perpendicular parking space.
The parking system beeps to warn of objects in front and behind the vehicle regardless of whether you are in reverse or drive.  So if there is an object in front of the vehicle yet you are backing out, it provides an audible warning which is distracting.
: When in AUTO on a cold morning, the fan immediately blows cold air until the engine warms up.  Every other vehicle I've owned will keep the fan OFF until the engine warms up.  BMW says to manually turn the climate control off for the first few minutes to resolve this.
Automatic opening of rear liftgate is inconsistent.  When gate has not been opened in a day or more it will not auto open on first try
Does not auto open every time
ability to stop turn signal without turning in other direction difficult
tire pressures require mulitple menu levels to find
No idea whether it is operational
Navigation system does not know where the car is. Shows that the car is in a different city or in the middle of a lake. Emergency call system  has a malfunction warning as well. Vehicle is currently at the dealers being fixed. : Emergency call malfunction. Currently at dealer to be repaired.
Tie down latches in back of second seat seem to rattle and make noise. I have moved them to the 'up' position; which seems to have helped.
Does not hold owners manual easily. Too small.
The thigh support extender on the front passenger seat is no longer working.
the heater blows cold air until the engine reaches operating temperature.
One fog light doesn't work properly, and it's on along with headlights. Both fog  lights work when I pressed the button, but it just keeps one on when fog button not pressed. I have not had the time to take it to get it fix.
The vehicle makes an unusual sound just after start-up after sitting overnight.  It is not any kind of real bother.  I just wonder why the noise.
can not see labels on wiper controls because of steering wheel, also rain sensor seems inaccurate
No Apple CarPlay available.  System is slow and cumbersome to enter destinations. Mapping system has many inaccuracy. iDrive control system is awkward.  A touch screen would fix many of the problems.
the height adjustment will only go UP when not seated in the seat, so if the seat is too high you have to crank your neck to get in, then lower the seat once your weight is on it.  Both driver and passenger seats are this way.  This is a design feature, not a malfunction.

Multiple steps; not worth the effort
Frequently mishears names and numbers.  Not really all that useful for commands.
The voice system is almost unusable, and the 'I-Drive' system is quirky and distracting.
noisy when car is on freeway
It's not intuitive what you need to do to activate the parking system. Holding down the button also is very tiresome.
It's not a smart design. The part with your coins moved and everything can fall out out.
Loss of power when on range extender on mountain hills. : Loss of power on steep mountain hills when using the range extender.
Don't use voice commands often, so not much experience. Have noticed troubles w/system understanding commands, so I don't use it much
Buttons are behind where my hand is so I have to move my arm back to us them.  There isn't room in the arm rest to move the controls any more forward.
: The keyless entry is temperamental.   Door does not always lock or unlock with use of keyless entry.
The car thinks that rear right door is not closed properly eventhough it is. : Noticed it in the last month
Difficult to get address from your phone
The rear drivers door seems to be shut, but once I start the car, the symbol for NOT SHUT comes on. Then I have to stop the car and get out to shut it again. Maybe the sensor is out of whack. It doesn't happen all the time though.
: The tire pressure light came on for no reason. That was on the second day that I got the car. At that time, there was no problem with the tires.  Then later in the month I got a nail in my tire. That is not the car's fault, but these tires cannot ever be repaired. That should have been explained to me or there should have been insurance to cover it. It was ridiculous to have to spend a $200 plus dollars to buy a new tire when the old one had barely been on the car.
Difficult to see. The navigation on my phone is easier to see. The navigation system seems too complex and to far from the driver to be seen clearly.
The system is really difficult to work. I've tried on a few occasions and haven't had much luck. Only once has it worked.
In general, using the the controls to enter a point of interest works, but takes a long time. I wish it worked like google where you could put in a poi or an address. Also, the map navigation screen is really hard to follow. Would be much better if it looked like apple maps.
need to closer rear doors very hard to engage.
Occasionally locks shut and can't open
Controls for volume too far apart.  If you change the music, you then have a long way to reach to control the volume.  volume control should be on left hand of steering wheel so it easier to access after changing music.  Fast forward is located very far away from the driver and often times the steering wheel control won't let you fast forward spotify application.
Vehicle is all-electric. No engine noise to muffle wind noise. Not necessarily a 'problem,' but it is more noticeable than in a conventional gas-powered vehicle.
Run Flat tires are more noisy than conventional tires. Lots of rough pavement in California.
Wish it had more space.
I don't experience it myself, but here in Oregon we're still not allowed to pump our own gas .  I've found the door 'jammed open' more than once after one of the gas station attendants puts gas in my car.  I then have to reset the  retention pin and carefully work the door closed.  It's maybe happened 3 times so far.
WIFI  does not connect,  The car automatically switches to pandora without asking
Need to strike a deal with Google.  They keep up to date maps; including newly opened freeways, etc.
The door pops open while driving every once and a while...
These are really attractive but they serve no purpose...they get your pants dirty trying to get in or out without hitting them.
It gets too hot even set at a cooler temperature
: Playlist support on iDrive is limited following the iOS 10 upgrade. Picking a song on the phone with an all-random setting turned on makes choosing a different song on the roller chooser  pick a completely random other song, not the one you picked. This problem only exists if the first song is picked manually on the phone itself.  A major problem: A severe lack of Android support hurts the reputation of this system. The lack of album art, playlist support, and Android Auto very much lowers my opinion of the quality of the iDrive system as a whole.  Another issue I have is the lack of retrofit options when new features come out. I fully expect that if 2018 models of the 4-series will have Android Auto support, BMW will offer me no option of retrofitting the compatibility for my current iDrive system. Using an excuse such as 'it requires new hardware' is just a lame cop-out. That's what retrofitting is for!  Updates to iDrive are also slow and rare.
Multiple issues. There is no 'sync' option for this supposed 'dual-zone' cooling/heating system, requiring *both* sides to be adjusted when controlling temperature. Also, the available adjustment of fan speed while in the 'auto' mode makes the system confusing. Shouldn't fan speed be adjusted to the desired temperature vs actual temperature? What does changing the temperature do then? It's quite a confusing system, in my opinion.
squeaks when reversing and at low speed
I was under the impression that one automatic windshield wipers are on, it automatically adjusts sensitivity. There is a control to adjust sensitivity 3 different ways
Phone does not pair with car's bluetooth consistently, every time I get in and out of the car it's a matter of crossing fingers and hopefully it will pair that occasion. It does not pair immediately upon starting the vehicle.
tires easily affected by potholes, normal road conditions. low quality pirellis on this vehicle as standard tires.
requires me to have to disconnect & reconnect several times in order to regain bluetooth connection sometimes
according to the manual, and the previous bmw that I had, the mirrors should fold when requested. They do not. I think it is a software problem because I can sometimes get them to fold, just not reliably and not as described in the manual.
seems the system is only reliable under certain conditions - driving on highway with cars approaching from rear at moderate speed differential. The rest of the time the system seems to ignore cars. Plus it is worse for cars on the right than for cars on the left. Overall - not particularly useful or reliable.
very, very unreliable. Often goes off when still in lane. Seems to think defects in road surface are the lane markings and sometimes thinks the off-ramp markings are the lane markings. So unreliable I had to turn it off.
Numerous points of interest, businesses, etc. are not found when doing a search. It is about the worst search capability I have seen, and it is incredibly slow. I have to look up things on my phone, get the address, and then hope the car GPS can find the location - which it doesn't always do.
unclear how parameters are stored and how to have the seat/mirrors return to stored state
controls are very confusing
when there is ice or snow you cant use this feature to lock the doors
the wheel does not get hot enough
there is vertually no storage in the vehicle
there is no place to put anything   the cup holders are too close to the radio controls and the center console does not exsist because of the wireless charging feature    my cadillac has a place in the console to slide phone in.
There was a dent on the front hood which was not noticed until a few days after delivery
Must look every time you want to use them; not a good place to put them
Does not cover the entire area
: Last week on a very frigid Sunday afternoon, I parked my vehicle in a parking-lot and came back one hour later to find my moonroof and all of my windows down.  This had happened once before in my three series during a rainstorm.  there's no rhyme or reason for it it just happens. Not a recurring thing.

It is not a big issue It is intermittent and can disappear for days.  It happens turning and starting from a stop. If I can ever reliably repeat the issue, I will take the car into the dealer. It sounds like something sliding on the plastic. Coins in the cupholder sound the same and I have removed the coins just to make sure that was not the issue.
Music player doesn't connect to car but telephone does. : My Bluetooth doesn't always allow the music to play from my phone. It always picks up the telephone but only the music about 50% of the time.
: dirty leather on delivery and it marks easily thereafter as well
It appears to excessive road noise when going above 65 mph.  I suspect that the noise to caused by the run flat tires.
Do not understand why the latch needs to be pulled twice to open
Fuel cap does not have any positive lock position feel
: Phone does not fit the charger as promised
Does not recognize the phone when I enter the car sometimes.
Can not move cargo cover put of the way
cover slides back and forth for seemingly no reason
Foot auto control trunk opener does not work when you put your foot under the back of the car . You have to keep swiping your foot multiple times under the back of the car  before the trunk will open..
: I drive a coupe, and to fold down land move the seat forward, there is a manual release on the shoulder of each front seat with a button to move the seat forward and backward, to allow easy passage for your back seat passenger. My Passenger front seats power shoulder sliding adjustment button would only work some of the time.
Brakes feel rough and squeak when first driving. It goes away after driving less than a mile
Wiper began streaking within a few weeks. Got it replaced and it began streaking at the exact same place within a couple of weeks. Got it replaced again and 3 weeks later doing well so far. Dealer could not find out why the t happened
Picks up color from clothing and looks dirty after a few uses.
: Sirius radio reception cuts in and out. I'm glad it's just a trial subscription.
The speedometer and tachometer are completely illegible during certain lighting conditions while driving.  I have had experienced when passing under an overpass or a on a wooded road in which the speedometer and tachometer almost 'grey' out and become impossible to read.  If the headlights come on then the speedometer and tachometer become legible, but this doesn't always happen in low light conditions.  A simple fix would be to make the background of speedometer and tachometer a different color.  Instead of a black background make it a white background.
The backup warning will not turn off until the vehicle is put into first gear and driven forward approximately one meter.  This makes parking in a small garage or parallel parking to be an annoying experience.  For example, the warning goes off when I park in my garage backing up to the rear wall.  In order to deactivate the warning I have to pull forward until the front end of the car is outside of the garage.  Put in reverse to back up and get the front end into the garage, then backup warning turns on again.  Only way to make it stop is to turn off the car.  Very annoying.
Dimming the mirror for night driving, control is too stiff & awkward to use.
Driver's side rear brake light failed
Does not always auto connect with phone in car
: The front cigarette lighter port is loose fitting for radar detector plug.  Same radar detector plug I was using in the 2014 BMW X3 that I traded in for this 2017 X4.  The radar Detector keeps losing power because the plug slips out of the loose fitting lighter port.
Sometimes, only one fog light comes on by itself
after unlocking the door from inside driver side control the issue resolved to date.
run flats develop side wall bubble easily and wear out sooner than conventional rubber tire. BMW should put normal rubber tires.
Several scratces around the shifter area , being that this is a lease and we have two other car so she don't drive this car.So she parked the car in the garage for about a week and when she took it out that's when she notice it.
: during cold weather..... temps below 25 degrees F......  engine shakes,  stumbles, runs extremely for about 1 minute and then operates normally.   this happens ocassionally, not a regular event
: The sun visor is too small
unusual operation
cannot remove stain
Doesn't follow commands for searching for GPS locations.  Using CarPlay with iPhone is a good alternative which works fine.
: radio changes from fm to pandora
memory seems to cancel itself out
Clock readout is small and gets lost amongst other data in the infotainment display.
No Comment
Not aimed high enough for proper visibility at higher speeds.
Located in the center console makes connected item inaccessible.
: rpm related harmonic then a metal clacking, then nothing, then , another clacking sound sound following by no unusual sound...these unusual sounds all appeared to come from the rear underbelly.   I took it to dealer and they concluded that it was related to opening under vehicle mechanics that permit pebbles to enter.  Noise stops after the pebbles are expelled.  The dealer stated they would get back to me to tell me if there was a fix to prevent pebble entry into mechanics of rear.  The dealer never followed up with me.  However, I have not had any significant event since  other then some periodic short noise events from what appears to be pebbles encountering the rear mechanics.
Difficult to input destination/points of interest verbally
The rattle is on and off
Confusing to use particularly auto sensor
Button confusing but not a big deal
Took me a while to figure out where it was located
Find difficult to use
Doesn't always find my phone
Cup holders are located in a spot where tall drinks dont fit well.  It makes it difficult to get them in or out.
Cup holders are not large enough for several containers that i use
: The intermittent windshield wipers do not wipe often enough.  It's annoying as I have to keep manually wiping when the car is moving at slow speeds.  The intermittent wipers work well when the car is moving at a higher rate of speed.
The glove box is difficult to close with only the manual in it.
Needs hardly pressed to stop
Driver's floor matslides around, making use of pedals difficult.  Floor mat on front passenger's side is very stiff and edges are folded into foot area.  This makes it uncomfortable.
Did not test drive this car prior, first time driving was delivery and monitor warning went on.  Technician reset and warning came  on again immediately.  Brought back to dealership and they kept it for a day to do a hard reset.  That was 4 months ago and the problem hasn't come up again.
Intermittent controls difficult to understand and apply
Connectivity drops when switching from Satellite to Pandora or ITunes
Hard to access from driver seat.  Revmoving items from console fall between seat and console.  Insufficient space, too shallow
Twisting one way turns on wiper twisting the other sprays water.  Rear wiper is rarely used and thus often twist the wrong way and spray when I wanted to wipe.
When signal has to be manually turned off, i.e. changing lanes to the left, when I turn it off, the right signal goes on.
I was not warned by backup camera, car backing up hit me. Sensor only makes noise when vehicle is less than a foot away.  By then, it is too late.
Sound goes softer to louder when the radio is on without anyone changing it.
Difficult to get the seat in the proper position.
It is hard to get the seat at the right adjustment in height as the distance to the gas/break also changes when you adjust the height.
The seat belt cuts into the drivers neck, it is not comfortable for an average height person, 
The material gets very dirty, shows dirt and leaves.  The trunk mat got dirty upon first use and does not come clean.
gets too hot.  hard to find.  can't tell whether its on or off aside from the temperature.
: the voice recognition system takes  few minutes to work.  BMW connect took a month to work correctly.  I would never buy an x3 again.  And will actively discourage people from buying one.
constantly drops phone calls.
: The user interface/options on my iPod do not translate fully to the audio controls in the vehicle.  They are even more limited when I use the USB connection versus Bluetooth.
: Temperature rises significantly when activating front defrosting mode, despite not changing temperature setting.  I suspect this may be 'expected' operation for this vehicle. I plan on discussing this with the dealership at my next visit.
Cup holders are a bit too small.
It sounds like crunching of a soda can, and seems to be coming from the rear differential area.  It happens infrequently, only decelerating/downshifting .
: The car should be able to play via USB my Apple iPod Classic, but it does not work properly. Problem occurs every time that you try to play a different artist or album. It takes repeated attempts before it will finally start playing, then it plays fine.
Missing the ash tray liner.
Drove car approximately 200 miles had had a blow out flat
i thought it is was, haveing never driver a 4 wheel drive before, but my son experienced it as well
in the winter i dont travel too far so not many miles, i am awating summer when i do longer drives to see how the consumption is then
: does not recognize the voice command correctly.
I've only tried a few times but when I ask to call someone it brings my whole phone book up and then will misinterpret the name or number.
Too many levers to manually control. Can be quite confusing.
I can't find where they are located.
Too many controls since they are manually operated.
Not sure how to operate.
I didn't know it would do voice commands. They are hard to understand manually.
Satellite radio frequently cuts out whenever the car is near buildings, power lines, etc. This problem never occurred with a prior car with satellite. Dealer says this is ""normal"". I consider it unacceptable.
Very complex system often requiring multiple steps to go from one setting to another. Would be better if it had more than 6 or 7 memory buttons
Latch is too tight -- cover must be yanked open
Only happens occasionally. I will have it buckled and then when i get out sometimes it does not retract and i pull on it and then it will go back.
I had previously leather seats which were easy to clean, this car has fabric seats and i noticed i  have a spot or two where someone has dropped food item on the seat that will not wipe away . also hair sticks to it rather easily and i have to have a lint brush in the car to keep it clean. i had a spot of something in the back seat but i was able to remove it with some oxyclean. I will eventually get the front seat cleaned with some cleaner but i have not had a chance yet.
When i received vehicle it was cool and then when i ran the a/c it would not work.  Then the check engine light came on and i asked them to also look at the air b/c it was not working and they fixed it.
As you get into and out of the car although the material is blackish, you can see all the in and out scuff marks from shoes and or items into the vehicle and trunk. Carpet soils easily and i have bought liners. : floor coverings were too light so i had to buy protective floor covering so not to ruin the originals, had a mechanical problem with air conditioning
Model didn't have a keyless entry door lock standard.
I don't understand how to navigate the complex system and the configuration has not made sense to me.I guess i just think differently than they do.
Engine noise 2900-3200 RPM - Loud, obnoxious, and has made a very dissatisfied customer after spending $55,000.00 on a brand new car. Dealer DID NOT CARE.
: Front wiper on passenger side does not clean very well
Wants me to turn on nonexistent street; maps my home in wrong location.
It does not auto adjust when crossing time zones 
There are so many steps to complete and wait for to pair other phones. My husband's phone  is always a drama to pair
I have to move the user's manual around to get it to shut. The manual is the only thing in the glove box
a rock hit the windshield while highway driving. I had it repaired by safelight. When shutting the engine hood a few days later, the whole window cracked.
: emergency phone calling modual did not work was fixed immediatley
Despite complete address entry, including zip code, system identifies locations miles away on same street. : Often routed via round-about route when shorter, direct route is available.
It's not broken. Just don't like the way it works.
When blocking sun from the side it is not long enough under many conditions .  It is fine for driving directly into the sun.
: The foot activated liftgate also works to close the liftgate.  We didn't know this and when standing at the back of the vehicle, it can sometimes activate while loading/unloading, causing the liftgate to start closing while you are under it.
: The auto wiper/rain detection setting for the windshield wipers doesn't appear to work consistently when there is intermittent drizzle.
The top left/left side of the windshield appears to fog sometimes and the auto setting for air doesn't clear it, I have to set to make defog/defrost to clear it away.
Must use left hand to search for the driver side memory for the seat position.   I have to open the door and adjust before entering the car.
Not actually sure if the sound or knocking is coming from the engine or from the transmission.
When i try to make a sharp last minute turn the car wont allow for a short turn. It makes you take a wide angle turn which i feel is dangerous because it forces you in the other lane.
The cup holder is below an angled dash which makes it difficult to reach and remove any item. Also, it is very forward, so one has to look down to reach.
It hasn't recognized 3 out of 20 or so addresses and wouldn't allow for manual bypass of the house number.
My car has the feature that you are supposed to be able to open the tailgate by putting your foot under the car.  Works for me no more than 10% of the time I try to use the feature.
Difficult to connect my daughter's IPhone to play music.  Was easier in my last X3 - wondering if the problem has something to do with using Apple Car Play
: Hatch opens halfway.
when I plug in my phone to this outlet there is no response
There are two different ways to turn the wipers on.  It is difficult to remember both ways, even after 10+ years of owning a BMW.  Yesterday I couldn't remember how to turn on the intermittent wipers and had to drive around with the wrong wiper speed for much of the day when suddenly I remembered another way to turn on the wipers.
The car gives a ""red"" warning and audible signal far before it is warranted.  When trying to park in a tight space the car is giving me a constant alert, which isn't helpful -- I KNOW I'm in a tight space -- don't give me the warning until I am actually in danger of hitting something.
For the life of me I can't figure out now these work, and when they do work they are SLOOOOOOOW.
Belt seems to be twisted internally. Will be taking it back to dealership to look at this issue withing the next week
: The white covering on my passenger side rearview mirror seems to have some blemishes within the paint. It's not an exterior scratch, exactly. They are deeper blemishes that are kind of like a web of interior cracks.   I noticed it about a month after I got my car when I was washing it for the first time.  I didn't take it in to the dealer because I feel like it's too late to bring up something like that. I mean, how do they know that I didn't hit something . I live in the city and even though my dealer is AWESOME, i just think it's too late to mention this. Besides, it's not hideous. I only notice it when I look closely.
It's very hard to get the car to give me directions somewhere. The system frequently misunderstands the street I've given, even though I try to speak very clearly.  It also doesn't seem to have built-in parameters telling it that it might be wrong. For instance, I live in Chicago, and sometimes I'll say a street clearly, and it will repeat back to me the wrong street in a city that is hundreds and hundreds of miles away. You'd think that it would default to places closer to home. Usually, after trying a few times to use the car navigation, I'll just go back to my iPhone and ask IT for directions, because the iphone seems to be programmed with some of those common sense parameters. Another time, I asked the car to send me to the nearest FedEx location. Even though I knew that I was pretty close to a FedEx , it gave me a location four states away.  So I just think the navigation in this car needs some improvements
The seat belt gets easily twisted up at the top , where it comes out of the door. So sometimes when i get in the car and go to pull down the seatbelt, it won't come down because it is twister. I have to turn around and jiggle the belt to untwist it so it can be pulled down.
The rubber button doesn't always trigger the release mechanism
it just sounds kind of loud
It starts back up after shutdown, seemingly randomly, if the traffic light is a little long, or if it's just stopped in traffic. I switched off this feature
: Using the USB connection to play music from my iPhone it doesn't recognize it the first time it's plugged in and I have to disconnect and re-connect it sometimes 3 times for it to work
hatch opened while I was driving; could not get the malfunction to repeat at the dealer
A button on the bottom left inside was popped out and kept me from closing the door; I had to push it in and out several times to get it to function propperly
just a difficult operation
: gear shift very easily is bumped into neutral
I just replaced my tire two days ago.
It takes longer but its more accurate when I manually type in the address or search using categories.
The seams are a bit more exposed in one section.  I don't anticipate the seams coming loose so I haven't reported it.
Sticks
The parking brake gets caught on the driver seatbelt latch.  This causes the brake to still be engaged sometimes and I don't notice until I have been driving for a while.  The brake should be moved over a bit so that it does not get caught on the seatbelt latch.  It gets caught when the seatbelt is latched and when it isn't.
I have no idea how it works.  The on/off is difficult to understand.  I can't tell the difference between the initial warning light and when/if the system engages.  I don't have confidence that it works.
The port is in a difficult location.  The port does not always work.  It has to be unplugged and plugged back in far too often.  I have an iphone.  The system does not always recognize it which is crazy.
The system is so convoluted and hard to use that I will just use my phone which is much easier and simpler.  It can take 15 minutes to enter a destination correctly.  By this time, you are so frustrated you do not want to use any enhanced features.
The seat adjustment is hard to use .  I feel like I am risking breaking it because I want it to go lower.
While in traffic I have had the engine stall because of downshifting from third to second or second to first
The vents are too low to be effective in cooling passengers. And there are no rear vents.
When the car is full of people, the maximum settings do not maintain enough air flow throughout the vehicle.
When the battery is highly charged, braking power is reduced.
Does not interpret the street number and street correctly.
Even on the highest setting through thin clothing, the ventilated feature is barely noticeable. I have ridden in friends' vehicles that have this feature and their seats cooled much better. Specifically, a friend's Jeep SUV seemed to much more useful. I do not think the extra cost was justified for this feature. I have not taken it to the dealership for repair because other BMW owners I've spoken with seemed to agree it's a design flaw and common to all BMW vehicles with ventilated seats.
The phone doesn't automatically pair.  Calls are dropped frequently for no apparent reason.
Secondary brake light warning indicator came on minutes after taking delivery of the vehicle.
sometimes the vehicle with detect a spot and after the vehicle is halfway into the spot, the car realizes the spot is too small and a notification will appear saying I need to take control.
only when car is placed in the sun you see many scratches on paint.
I expected a much better sound isolation from a car at this level and price
30% of cases phone won't connect or bt audio won't work
eventhough the car nav system UI is ok, it's confuding rather use my phones system instead
: Can' find a good driving position with current seats
Apple Car Play does not seem user frendly and does not operate in multiple languages as I need. My iPhone supports such multi-language operation, but Apple Car Play will not.
Sometimes, do I seem to close the passenger door adequately, I get in the car and there is a white showing that it is open. I have to slam it again.
The biggest problem is that the door is to the right rear of the car ?√É¬∂ too far away for some charging stations. It's not about opening.
It gets pretty loud.
Often behind steering wheel.

Takes too long - if fully discharged, not enough time to recharge overnight. That's with 110 V.
The place to insert the seatbelt buckle is tight next to the seat and center console.  Needs to come up higher so it can be accessed easily.
: When pairing my phone to the Bluetooth to listen to music, I am unable skip/change songs using the wheel controls. I would have to change this either by touching my phone screen or using the central knob to navigate all entertainment.
It was a little difficult to find the location of the recliner adjustment. It is placed on a small portion of the adjustment for the height.
Noticed dent at delivery
Cover piece, about 4-6' in width, that I believe covers the 'hitch' at front bumper, was missing. I had it replaced right away, but again it fell off and was lost within a month later. I has again been replaced.
Other than the 'auto' button on the end, I am not able to completely figure out how to turn them on or off. Sometimes I just need to wipe once to clear the windshield! Also, since installing the Click & Drive I find more often than not I end up spraying my windshield or turning on wipers inadvertently...not fun when the window is down or sunroof is open!
When I want to open my sunroof, almost 100% of the time I want it open all the way, not 2/3. It would be better if the switch opened the sunroof at one touch and it opened ALL the way. I consistently have to hit it once to find it opened only about 2/3, then have to hit it a second time to open it all the way.   Another note, it would have been a great bonus if the rear sunroof opened as well. However, I realize that may be logistically not feasible.
: Intermittent Satellite Radio  that cuts out for long periods of time. Dealer Service technician investigated and found it's a recurring problem with Sirius XM technology, of which they're working on improving.
system is very 'clunky' not user friendly. Seems like old technology : audio software is difficult to operate. controls for usb connected devoices do nopt work like radio controls
connectivity is 'old' fashioned. Should have apple or android car play
blocked by side panel if you are tall
blocled by side panel if you are tall
Control is together with recliner and is confusing
When I lift the bar under the seat I still have trouble sliding the seat.
I have not taken it back, just need to practice with them.  I am a little annoyed that in order to have power seats and a garage door opener, you have to purchase an expensive power package with many items that I do not want or need.
It is in a center console cubby, not lighted and hard to reach. : It is difficult to find the port to plug in my iPhone. It's not in plain sight nor lighted. It's in a center console cubby. I have to use a flashlight to see it.
Sometimes if I give a direct command like 'Call Mom', the system asks me to input a telephone number instead of finding 'Mom' in the directory.
: There is not enough lumbar in the lumbar support feature. Also, the leather seats are picking up the color from my jeans. I don't have that problem on my leather furniture.

The recline option is located underneath the seatbelt once it is buckled. Unless you remember to move the seat before buckling, it becomes very hard to use. It's also located very far back which makes it hard to reach with the natural biomechanics of your arm.
When I ask the blue tooth to call a certain person, it does not understand my voice.
The display on the navigation does not give all the information I require or am used to. I like a nav system that tell the exit numbers and what is at each exit. I also have not been able to save an address to the address book.
Actually, I filled this out wrong.  It's the driver side mirror that has condensation.
It didn't seem to happen when I test drove, but it appeared within a week.
WHEN THE CAR IS RUNNING A LOT OF NOISES  IS COMING FRON THE TIRE, AND I WILL TAKE THIS WEEK TO THE DEALER.
WHEN THE AIR CONDITION IS STARTED THE AIR  IN THE FRONT VENT SMELL BAD, I WANT TO TAKE THE CAR THIS WEEK
I've never used cruise control before. It might have come in handy on my trip from NJ to NC but I never used it because I was afraid....it seemed complicated and that was the last thing I wanted was complications.
The first time I went out at night I didn't have my headlights on. Thank goodness it wasn't that dark but I had to read the manual when I got home to find them.
I might as well be speaking another language. I don't dare use it while driving because I'm too distracted by its lack of proper response. It's extremely frustrating!!
It has happened enough that I don't trust the navigation system in the car. I typically reach for my phone before I use navigation in the car.
small scratches
: the tailgate door is supposed to open with motion.  It does unlock but only fully pops open occasionally
With so many options, each assigned to even the specific key in use, tuning the radio becomes a detailed chore that can't be done while driving. This can get very confusing when both keys are in the car. It's not obvious which key is in control. I set up the preset buttons below the center display screen for several radio stations, but once I turned off the car, that setup disappeared and I can't even remember how I did it. The manual doesn't appear to have information about this.
Phone book names are misinterpreted and once that happens it defaults to what it thinks it has heard over and over. Requires manual search. Sometimes the phone book does not load and in these cases, requires pulling over to use the connected device by hand.
I have two phones paired, mine and my wife's. Sometimes, if I am in close proximity to the house, or garage, the system is confused as to which phone it should pair with. Once it gets confused you cannot override and actively pick which phone to pair with. This often requires driving some distance before it rectifies itself. Very often, the best solution is to find a place to pull over, and turn the car on and off completely.
The trunk opening is very small. Because it is a convertible MINI has taken advantage of the cloth top to offer a way to make the opening larger, by raising the back end where the roof meets the body. It is a slightly complicated system but useful and more a positive than a negative feature.
The MINI is not very aero dynamically styled and the cloth top of the convertable tends to let in more air noise
Hard to hear music/radio at speeds over 50 mph - road noise seems excessive.  Previous cars have been much quieter.
See previous comments.
Display for fuel usage appears at random times.  I cannot figure out how to get that display when I want it, but it usually shows up towards the end of a tank of gas.  For a while, a red and blue display appeared that said 'warm' or 'cold' - something I don't understand and didn't program.  When I think I'm adding/deleting display items, no changes occur.  It may be that I can't do that while driving, but nothing says that.  VERY frustrating instructions and descriptions, e.g. 'central instrument' v. 'control'.  What is the difference?!
: System allows only one connected device so I can either use the blue tooth capacity with my phone or listen to my music on a iPod connected by aux cord.  I didn't understand that limitation and was frustrated by having the blue tooth work 'intermittently.'  I don't like this limitation. Also, preset radio stations change themselves from time to time - very annoying.

No fresh air vent!  And I can't tell how to adjust the vent from defrost to simple circulation.  Buttons show windshield defroster but no button clearly indicates other air circulation.
: Mildew/musty smell when I turn on AC or heat.
It had water buildup inside the casing.
The controls are down under the left side of the dashboard close to my knees.  It's easy to accidentally change the light selection.
: It 's not so much a problem as it is just very inconvenient to use the controls while driving.  I think it is unsafe.
: I don't think the windshield wipers do a very good job.  I will bring this to dealer's attention at first service.
system not user friendly or intuitive.  I needed to purchase the manual which was not included with the car
Must click through multiple modes to select desired mode
The auto adjustment doesn't seem to happen for the secondary driver of the car
The cup holders are too small for most containers and too close under the dash for many containers to sit upright
Noticed a ""gouge"" in the windshield on the driver's side. It was deep enough that it required replacement, it was about an 1/8"" long and in the driver's view, especially when driving into the sun. Don't know if it was a defective from the manufacturer or it happened during installation or delivery of the vehicle.
Brakes make a groaning noise for the first few minutes of the first drive.
It's hard to see the control behind the steering wheel. Cannot tell that it's turned on
It doesn't get warm enough to be comfortable in the winter
Takes a few minutes to connect with my phone
Nav system missed highway entrances/exits
needed to add air to all 4 tires so that the pressure was ideal for driving
: on Saturday, February 18th, 2017 we experienced an issue with our car. Keep in mind, we have not even had the car for 2 months. It was almost 1am when we decided to return to our car. The key and it did not unlock the car doors. My husband opened up his key in order to access the actual key to physically open up the driver side door. The alarms went off immediately and we decided to try out the SOS feature in the car since this was technically an emergency where we would need assistance from BMW. This feature turned out to be totally useless; the operator came on and kept repeating options such as ""press 1 for... or press 2 for ..."" The BMW does not have number choices so this was pointless. We eventually used our phones and had to call up BMW customer service. The person on the phone simply told us that since the keys did not unlock our car, this meant that the car battery must be dead.YouTube suggested holding up the key next to the key symbol by the steering wheel.
please refer to previous explanation of my problem...
refer to original problem explanation
: Rattle on rough roads from rear view mirror.
Car does not feel as refined as my E90 in regards to the interior
: EXTERIOR SIDE-VIEW MIRRORS used to rotate down when the car was put into reverse, and rotate back up again when the car was put into drive. Twice the mirrors failed to move back up again when the car was put in drive. Now they do not rotate up or down automatically.
There is often a 1-2 minute delay before the vehicle and my iPhone 7 will pair.
often seems"" confused"" about streets and which city those streets are in in spite of telling the city name.
I have a convertible so the tailgate swings down.  On numerous occasions when I thought I had closed it properly, I would be driving, come to a stop and look at the gauges and see a warning that the tailgate was not closed.  That warning light goes away as soon as you continue driving.  So you could be driving for a long time and not know the tailgate isn't latched properly until you stop or put it in Park.  I think that warning should stay on continuously until you close the tailgate properly.
: Noticed a squeek/rattle in the passenger side window within about 2 weeks of taking delivery.  I don't believe it's the door; just the window.
They changed bulbs to LED lighting  Xenon was much brighter
This is our fourth BMW. All have had issues with brake dust. This car has far less brake dust than the older BMW's but still too much in my opinion.
The electric steering in this car has a much different 'feel' than our older BMW's. It seems much more difficult to keep the car tracking in a straight line at any speed. However, in 'sport' mode the steering 'feel' is excellent. I wish there was a way to select the sport mode steering settings while in 'comfort' mode.
We had to go back to the dealer to learn how to use Apple Car Play functions. It not as seamless as it should be. It would be great if the system would pair with the iPhone associated with the driver profile of each vehicle key. Instead, it automatically pairs with my wife's iPhone even when I start the car with my key. Then I have to manually pair my phone which is slow and sometimes doesn't work at all.
Audio system just stopped generating sound. Everything else worked but there was zero volume.
smell from the PU seat
Hidden in the lower right-hand corner; have to look for it.
the trunk makes a weird noise when open and close.  My previous X3 didn't experience that
i fund this 2017 X3 more noise tan my previous one
again it might seem repetitive, but I never experienced this with my previous X3.  This is a brand new car so I think that it should not shake as much as it does,especially when driving on the highway
sometimes it take me to a different location.
: doesn't turn off radio when engine turns off and you walk away from car.
I am short and require my seat to be as high as possible. In addition to not being able to rest my arms anywhere, I also am not able to adjust the steering wheel in a way that it can be both comfortably positioned and see the blinker flashing on my dashboard (it gets slightly obscured by the top of my steering wheel, requiring me to look around it.
Text messages sent through the app don't always send. When connected via bluetooth, the sounds from my phone don't feed through the cars speaker system . Will be able to see an incoming call on my car's screen and accept the call, but phone doesn't always connect with the car's speaker system once the call is accepted.
There is no armrest built into the seat and the way my seat needs to be adjusted for my height doesn't allow me to use the center console as an armrest.
: I am short and require the seat adjustment to be high. There is no armrest and my seat adjustment makes it impossible for me to use the middle console as an armrest. Not a 'problem' per se, but it makes my driving experience less than perfectly comfortable for longer drives as compared to other luxury vehicles I've driven in that have arm rests.
Warning light comes on intermittently.  Began 3 ?? months after delivery
lumbar support appears to be inflatable so it seems to deflate after several days. It is also difficult to get it in the correct position as it has a 4 way adjustment that is difficult to set.
The shape of the seat is not as comfortable as other vehicles I have owned. The upper back support is poor as it scoops in for my height, the lumbar support is hard on your lower back and difficult to adjust. Have not taken it to the dealer because that is the way the seat is designed.
For mens feet or a thick soled show these pedals are so close together it is actually possible  that you can step on the gas and the brake at the same time.
The monitor is on the mirror and makes you take your eyes off  the road to notice it.  Not an 'active enough' system
If this had a warning sound too it would be helpful
Compared to Toyota Highlander this system is more complex to operate and it is not as aggressive in the alert/avoidance mode.  It is not clear this work in an intern setting.  Seems to only work in the 'cruise control' mode.
: The engine seems to lurch forward when it is cold.
The door has a release that you have to push inside of the vehicle.  I often forget to push that button before going to pump gas, and then I have to get back into the vehicle to push the release button.  If the door is unlocked, the cover for the gas tank should just open with a push .
The seat simply has a fan that ventilates the seat.  The fan is noisy, and the seat doesn't cool at all .
The owner's manual does not fit well into the glove box.  It will fit, but you have to hold it on an angle while closing the glove box with your other hand.
It is not really a problem but I didn't notice it on my previous X6
The steering wheel heat button is located on the steering column right next to the steering wheel position adjustment button and it's easy to press the wrong one because you can't  actually see it when you're driving.  The heat works great though.
The navigation system *needs* to be updated to show all of the public EV chargers around town.  Right now, it only shows a small fraction of them and I have to get this info from Google Maps.
IT does not respond to the foot under the trunk much of the time. Annoying when my arms are full.
I have to 'hit' it several times to find the right spot to close it.
I don't work well with icons and there are too many options until I spend enough time to get used to it. But of course it rained before I did that.
the steering wheel blocks the view most of the time.
INtermittantly gives the wrong address even state and does not respond correctly to the voice command.
Every once in a while it acts as if there is no connection and I have to redo it.
: getting the seats to respond to my key fob when I enter.: As indicted earlier, it does not seem to automatically go to my position if the other fob has been used previously. IT goes to that position after I use the car if the other person opens the door.
I stil don't get the siding knob from blue to red and how that relates to the temperature control settings.
This occurs when it is raining and I first get in the car and want to drive. It takes a very long time for the rear window to defrost.
It is so flat that most bags are not easily secured. Pretty useless for groceries,
Driver side rear passenger window trim loose/detaching. Identified issue within first 3 weeks.
Paint bubble/chip. very small
: Faulty driver's door actuator that prevented the door from being opened from inside.
'M Performance' decal on rocker pannels began pealing off .
when driving on the highway, I feel that the car pulls to the right. I need to hold the steering wheel tighter than I did with my previous vehicle.
I find the front wiper controls confusing. I don't like that I have to turn on the rain sensing each time I get in the car. I wish it would stay on until shut off.
I find the memory on the drivers seat not passenger to be difficult. I expected that I would press the preset and it would go to the correct spot. It requires me to keep my finger on it until it is done.
It's the design of rear door.
While the suicide doors is great concept, the front door must always first be opened before the rear door can be opened or closed. The front seat passengers must also unbuckle their seat belt for entry or exit for rear seat passengers using the rear doors.
the system consistently asks for clarification of names mentioned and often incorrectly asks to confirm the name mentioned.
The second cup holder must be extracted from the center console then inserted in front of the fixed cup holder.
: Due to the vehicle not fully charging over-night , the range was not comfortable enough for driving a distance of approximately 80 miles for the day.  There were also no charging stations at the destination or near a convenient location along the route.  I do not have a high 240v wall charger.
Received notice from manufacturer that airbag is defective and at this Point the parts are not available to remediate
Any time I try to use the voice command to find a destination in the navigation system, it finds a random place that's not even remotely accurate. It is comical how inaccurate the system is.  It's virtually unusable so I have to manually type in any address or use the app on my phone to send the address to my car.
The cup holder has an elevated ring that's a couple inches off the base.  This is a poor design because if you want to put anything in the cup holder besides a drink , it will slide out and end up on the floor.  The cup holders are also very large and do not taper at all so unless you have a 32 oz. drink or larger, expect your drink to slide around in the cup holder.
Condensation goes away as the temperature inside the car adjusts and dehumidifies.
Night vision camera didn't come on. Had to turn the car off, wait 10-15 min, then restart car to get it to work. Condensation inside the lens housing of the camera makes the display on Head Unit hard to use after a humid day or rain.
: When the moonroof is opened while driving it's almost possible to hear anything inside the car.
There is so much beeping when backing up, it's hard to understand what I'm specifically doing wrong. Overwhelming beeping!!
The navigation system input mechanism is too time consuming. It's far easer to connect iphone and using an external app.
I have only attempted to use it once and it was difficult to understand what the next step is.
I can not use voice commands to tell and address of point of interest.
It is 1st noticed obviously when you 1st enter the car. We have tried Air Freshners to no avail.
the trunk opens when the latch is released.  however this works makes it difficult to close the trunk, provides a lot of resistance to closing
It has issues with my iPhone 7.  They have gotten better but they persisted for months.
There were no manually removalable headrests.  I had to have the dealer remove them as they interfered with a car seat install.
The floor mat pops up almost every day
The check engine light came on and they didn't go into deetail why.
Head-up display seems not aligned correctly. Cuts of on the far right edge.
Car was built only with parallel parking, even though it seems it has all cameras/sensors to do perpendicular parking 
It came on for a couple of days and it went off by itself. Dealer was informed and asked to wait a couple of days to see if it would disappear.
Car would not move backing from garage.
does'nt aiways understand the address
Need to close door very hard in order for it to close. It has remained open on several occasions without my knowledge.
I believe the latch is not catching correctly or must be misaligned.
Center console is very hard to open. Must slam shut as well.
the two step system to unlock car from inside is STUPID
system defaults to pandora on start up
When it is cold outside the door will not close all the way unless slammed or until the car warms up
: Voice recognition system does not work at all.  It dials my phone number and then disconnects it and then returns to whatever previous audio I was using .
Color from clothes fades onto the tan leather easily.
I have only fueled a couple of times since I bought my car. Sometimes it is a little hard opening the fuel cap. Maybe I just need to get used to it.  I Only mentioned it because I want to be thorough and helpful.
Clutch pedal has far too much travel, leg is fully extended to depress clutch but when resting on engaged pedal knee is nearly hitting steering wheel with steering wheel fully extended/up. Clutch also too close to a lip at the bottom of the dash so the toe clips the dash in certain shoes.
Steering has no road feel, especially in the wet.
: Within 1-2 minutes of startup, about 60% of the time the audio source switches itself to another semi-random input 
Random. Sometimes it works really well and other times it doesnt.
Besides the fact that it is in a stupid location can't tell if it is on or not does not come on the dash
When shutting the hood you have to make sure you slam it down so BOTH latches connect.  If you do a soft close only one of two latches connect causing half of the hood to not close.
Hard to see gauges during daylight hours.
Doesn't always alert as expected. Can't rely on this system to avoid collisions. I hope BMW is working on to improve it. I had same issue with my previous 2014 BMW 328xi. It hasn't improved in 3 years by BMW.
You can't see head-up display if you are wearing a Polarized sunglasses. This is a serious issue and BMW should fix it. This is a manufacturing defect and it can't be fixed at dealership/service center. I had same problem with my previous 2014 BMW 328xi. This problem has not been fixed by BMW in 2017. : You can't see head-up display if you are wearing a Polarized sunglasses. This is a serious issue and BMW should fix it.

Heated steering wheel is at inconvenient location. It should on dashboard or steering wheel. Can't see if the switch is on/off. It's a manufacturing problem.
USB port is at inconvenient location.
I have Apple Car Play feature in my BMW. It is not as useful as it should be. For example: If I turn off Apple Car Pay, I can easily see list of songs/radio stations, recently used phone numbers etc. on Head-Up-Display. Once I turn ON Apple Car Play I can't access that. I have to look at the navigation screen to operate it which is distracting and not safe. For songs/radio, I just have next & previous song option, it's not enough and if I push phone button on steering wheel, phone menu appears on navigation screen instead of head-up display which is not good. The whole point of Apple Car Play is to make everything easier and make sure driver can keep eyes on road. This feature doesn't help me. I have stopped using Apple Car Play option on 1st day. As this was a new feature, I was very excited to use it but it's not worth. Waste of money and distracting. I hope BMW and Apple will work together to improve it. This is a manufacturing problem. Can't be fixed at dealership.
Navigation system some times show wrong routes or wrong exists on freeways. It looks like a software problem.
Sometimes I drive with passengers and sometime drive alone. If people have left heating/cooling control on in rear seat and then if I'm driving alone, I can't see if the rear controls are on or off. There should be small button or a LED light to notify driver that rear fan/cooling/heating is ON. so it can be turned ON/OFF as needed. : Driver doesn't know if the rear heating/cooling controls are ON/OFF.
Some parts can get scratches easily
There are some compatibility issues with Apple Play and BMW Bluetooth.  It took a while to figure out that you cannot be connected to apple play and have the BMW  Bluetooth system work  I chose to turn off apple Play and use the BMW bluetooth exclusively and it works fine
It needs to go into the shop and diagnosed and repaired.  No matter how hot the interior is when in Auto climate control mode it blows on the lowest fan speed and does not ue recirculated air unless you put the system on Manuel and work it that way
: Automatic Climate control you set a temperature and if the car is hot it does not go to Max and then back down as it gets cooler
Again this in only in Auto Climate mode in Manual it works
Found a piece of plastic on the floor looks like a piece of trim
The engine turns off when I come to a stop at a traffic light and sometimes requires several tries to turn the ignition on before I get the car to move again.
Provided earlier.
The problem could be my phone and not the car, but this is the only car that has this issue.  The phone intermittently does not automatically pair or will unpair while I'm driving and at times in the middle of a call.
There is a brief groan whn braking hard, I assume due to the fact that brakes are rarely used with electric regeneration doing most of the 'braking' in normal driving conditions. Applying the [arking brake also makes a similar groaning noise.
Seatbelt is difficult to reach
The storage compartment that is between the driver and passenger seat is difficult to use because it's placed in a difficult spot.
: Bluetooth static when receiving calls.
: On the drivers side rear hatch door, the hinge was not adjusted properly.  This cause the door to not open when the button on the dashboard, as well as the key fob was pushed.  It would unlatch, but not open completely.
Honestly I haven't even figured out how to do this. I know it said it has a lumbar support, but there are something like four ways to change the seat positions and all of the seat adjustments are confusing.
As I mentioned on the lumbar....there are just too many ways to change the seats with all the adjusters in a different form. Then, there is no memory so even if you finally get it the way you want it and someone else drives your car, you are back to square 1.
: 1) I want to turn off the rear door opener on my key fob or have the system changed so that when I lock the car doors, the rear door locks too. I sometimes activate the rear door opener unknowingly while the key is in my pocket. Then when I go to open my garage door , the garage door scrapes against the opened rear door of the Clubman as the garage door comes up. 2) I'd like to turn off the function that allows me to open the rear door of the vehicle using my foot under the license plate. Sometimes I trigger the opener when I'm walking behind the vehicle. Again, I believe the best way to solve both of these problems is to have the vehicle lock function lock the back door as well as the passenger doors so that I have to unlock the vehicle before I open the rear door, using either the key fob or using my foot under the rear license plate.
Gas and brake pedals are close enough to make it a tight squeeze getting my foot from one to the other. I'd feel the car is safer to drive if there were more room.

There seems to be a small issue on passenger side windshield column clear coat.  I have not taken it to the dealer to rectify yet.
: Steering wheel does not telescope out far enough  Anti-lock brakes engage too strongly when not needed
I have the Ivory White and Black Nappa leather combo seats. It is expected, but the ivory definetely gets dirty easily
The windshield in front of passenger seat has a ripple effect that distorts some images if viewed from a specific angle from the driver seat
This is an issue with most modern BMW's, where excessive wind and road noises can be heard from the side windows. The windows are too thin and allow noises to enter the cabin. This issue started around 2011 with the new X3  and 3 series  vehicles. This carried into the i3 chassis as well. I'd rather have a little bit of extra weight and a quieter interior.
Also present with my previous 2014 i3 ReX. The vehicle has fantastic acceleration, but poor braking for a BMW. Even with the vehicle's low weight and electric regen, the braking performance is very poor. Even with a heavy stomp of the brake pedal, there is no ABS interaction until lower speeds. Even with tires as skinny as on this vehicle, friction limited braking is rare. This is not common BMW braking behavior. Heavier BMW's with a entry level brake package stop better than this vehicle.
: 1) The radio controls being on the right side of the steering are very annoying. These controls should be on the left side of the steering wheel to allow for better control of the audio system.   2) The rotary wheel for advancing music track selection should also allow for 'Previous' and 'Next' track. This makes Next track selection with the bluetooth/USB feature impossible with the steering wheel controls and the next track must be selected via the I-drive controller or ASK buttons.  3) The 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons for the audio system are on the very right side of the audio system control panel . This makes quick track stations very difficult without having to reach into the passenger's area. BMW's are supposed to have 'Driver-centric' controls and the placement of this switch in this location violates this premise.
Does not affect situations where the vehicle was preconditioned. Occurs below 50 degrees F. Upon placing the vehicle in the 'ready' state, the climate control will blow cold air, even with the HVAC set in 'auto'. The electric heater doesn't seem to heat up as strongly as with my 2014 i3 ReX. Heater will blow cold air for a few minutes after the trip has started.
: Vehicle pulls slightly to the right even though the alignment has been confirmed.  Reported to dealer who states it is a known problem and can be fixed with a part exchange, but assured me that the pull will not impact tire wear or other performance.  Waiting to see if that is true.
I cannot understand what the controls are supposed to do.  The instruction manual doesn't seem to agree with what happens when I move the control button.  Hard to get adjusted to a correct, comfortable setting.
There is a rattle in the rear driver side door that does not appear to be caused by anything loose in the outer door cover.  Will report to the dealer at my next visit.  Not bad enough to make a special service visit for.
sensor issue.  Not a big deal...
Door lock button is in center of dashboard---needs to be on driver's door
After delivery took my vehicle back to the dealer. The technician found that the manufacture associate left the item number between the speaker and the seal. Removed and the sound is awesome. I recommended to the dealer that they test the vehicle before delivery.
Anytime I'm driving there is a lot of wind noise in the vehicle.
There is a lot of wind noise
: The Apple Car Play feature which enables me to take and place calls, play music from my iPhone, etc., occasionally drops out and does not function smoothly.
Electric motor did not work upon delivery, needed to visit service center for software update.
I wish I could just select intermittent wiping rather than ghaving to rely on sensor system
Not a good location to easily turn on or off
Awkward to use as if using a non BMW supported app can't chang player unles opening console door.
Vibration sound on drivers side with highway speeds and rougher pavement
Have roof rack - maybe this is normal
For carplay, sometimes have to ""forget device"" then re-pair if pairing fails
All rubber trim around tops of driver/passenger front/back windows is discolored and faded with spots.  It was this way when we picked up the vehicle.
Difference between a quick lane change bump , and full engaged blinker is not clear.  I end up engaging full blinker on a lane change, then when attempting to cancel the blinker after the lane change, I end up signaling the opposite side blinker.
location between two drink holders is very inconvenient.  You end up bumping the power plug/cord every time you interact with your drink cup. : Power adaptor plug is between the driver and passenger cup holders.  This makes it difficult to place drinks in the holders without hitting the power cord/adaptor.
Programing the Home Link Garage Door Opener was more difficult than any other Home Link system I've ever used.  When clearing out the home link using buttons 1 and 3, the blink patterns did not correlate to the Drivers Manual.  Trial and error over an hour finally got lucky and was able to program the rolling code garage door opener.  Trust me, I've done this on at least 10 cars over 17 years , this was the least user friendly.
Headrest is too far back when in it's normal position, but allows for adjustment forward.  Unfortunately, the adjustment is only a tilt forward at the top .  So the top of the headrest pokes the back of your head just at one horizontal pressure point.
Program doesn't seem to synch with keys as mentioned in the driver's manual .  Also, I've programed the memory a few times, and then pressed it and it went to the wrong location .  Nobody else has access to the car.
My wife is unable to get the car into reverse because the detent resistance is too strong.  She has to hit the gear knob with a left striking motion to get it in reverse.
Clutch is very difficult to operate.  Very touchy, very difficult to drive smoothly.  Transmission clunks a lot when pressing in the clutch  between first and second, or between second and third.  I'm not a rookie manual driver ... I've had many sports cars and this is the most difficult transmission/clutch I've dealt with, including Porsche 911S, Corvette, Mustang Shelby, BMW 335, etc.
Known design defect in this car that BMW refuses to acknowledge.
They are sport seats, so not totally unexpected. However, the level of noise is surprising.
The car makes way too much noice for this price point. So much noise that it is difficult to pinpoint where it is coming from.
mainly when going over loose impediments
: not able to play downloaded songs from my i phone through the system.
noticed it after filling with premium gasoline.
Audible indicator stopped working.
Indicator to small on mirror and does not come on soon enough
Apple car play not connecting to voice/audio correctly
Condensation goes away after time but it comes and goes.
The vehicle was not shutting some properly causing the keyless entry to stop working.
Sat??lite radio would not work. : Radio head unit including Sirius radio and nav failed on delivery date. It has since been replaced.
Nav would not load at all.
I noticed this after the radio head unit was replaced.
Squeaking in the column between the front and rear doors.
In the orientation at the dealership at the time of vehicle acquisition, the person conducting the 'onboarding' training was not knowledgeable about our vehicle model.  I specifically asked him how to adjust the driving mode to ensure that I had the 'stiffest' drive.  He said it didn't matter.   I learned the hard way on my first trip with my new car that the steering wheel had too much play when turning and scrapped my right front wheel cap.  I studied and learned that setting the vehicle mode to sport with both drive and chassis set at sport provided me the stiffer drive that I need and like with BMWs.
Being 5ft 1inch in height, I need to maximize the height of the seat as well as being able to adjust the seat to operate the pedals comfortably.  At our on-boarding session, I had a difficult time with the seat being too low--the dealership person advised me that was the highest the seat could reach.  After 2 weeks of difficulty and a sore back, I hauled the manual out and studied; I set the seat tilt adjustment such that I maximized the seat's height and solved the dilemma myself.
The seat buckle does not easy insert to lock.
With the air conditioning running at 60 degrees, the windshield fogs with 'dewdrops' in the glass of the windshield.  I've tried to wipe it from the inside while driving.
It barely holds anything.  The design and shape is awkward and impedes ability to use the space provided.
: small rattle in front passenger door
Often doesn't open when you swipe foot underneath.  I hate that I have to reach into middle of dashboard to get back doors and hatch to unlock
Hard to manipulate especially to close
There is not enough interior storage space overall in the car
Not enough places to put things in the car
Needed to replace NVLD pressure switch
Compared to my Iphone this is not intuitive and user friendly software
Picks wrong 90 degree parking slot. Controls are hard to find -get thru main menu.
Center console/arm rest box contents often block insertion of smart cards into USB slot. Above USB slot cannot be accessed while vehicle is underway. Cannot charge cell phone unless smart card is removed. Car must be underway to charge cell phone.
Input with dial is impossibly difficult. Dial input with finger is impossible. Destination is frequently lost - requires complete re-input.
Auto setting takes too long to lower temperature after starting out.  Always requires use of Max A/C. Auto setting allows car to get too hot when in engine start/stop mode, especially in traffic but also just at a traffic light.
The hands free opening feature is very inconsistent .
: The hands free opening feature is very inconsistent . I always keep my key in the same place and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't . I used the website to report this issue, very curt and unsatisfactory  response
I have a Ford Explorer also. TheGPS etc is so much easier to use and the interface is so much more attractive . It gives a visual image of the exit. It also easily interfaces with the phone or Waze or GPS. These are design issues, not repair issues
It just doesn't work that well in real life
The interface is cluttered and unattractive . It doesn't allow the smartphone GPS to be heard. It's basically hideous
An odor emanates from the trunk that smells bad. Still have not identified the cause but it is not distracting enough to cause note
Acceleration is compromised in city driving. Have not had extensive highway drive yet..
Front passenger complains that the cross body seat belt strap is in an uncomfortable position.
Both front seat occupants have  difficulty placing and removing a large ""16 ounce"" metal reusable ""Starbucks"" cup in the front cupholders. The allowable space is limiting and is a long reach.
I adjust the drivers seat to a position that slightly impedes my exit from the car, while exiting both my shoes and my waist area rub against the lower door panel and door weather stripping leaving scuff/abrasion marks. The black carpet also soils easily, especially in the winter with road salt being a huge problem.
braking is not smooth
Difficult to use system, especially when cities have multiple zip codes and the system won't recognize the zip code.
: System take some time to connect to devices
clock and mileage difficult to see/obscured by steering wheel when looking forward
seat belt comes across my anterior neck/trachea. Have to keep in under my left arm and across the chest
Fans blow air very weakly
too small
too small
Automatic foot activated function did not always work.  Tailgate would open and close on it's own. : Automatic tailgate problem.
The foot-assist operation does not always open the hatch.
BMW moved the control to the left side of the steering column under the turn signal arm  Awkward location.
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't...very finicky
Open the rear tailgate with the handle works fine.  Kicking my foot under the bumper to open the tailgate often takes 5+ tries for it to work, usually resulting in me using the handle instead.
Pretty sure this is tire noise due to run flat tires with large rims. Overall the car is probably quieter than any car I have driven.
sunroof would not close after having the roof open and driving on the freeway. Resetting the system fixed the problem, but I had to search youtube to actually figure out how to do the reset. It was mentioned but not clearly detailed in the cars manual
interpretation of voice commands for navigation nearly always is wrong. Numbers, street names, even state is wrong. I would estimate only a 10% success rate
Samsung Galaxy Note 5 sometimes will not automatically connect to the car via Bluetooth.  Most of the time I can browse music on my phone using categories. However, this sometimes changes to only next or previous song. This error seems random, and sometimes occurs after the phone is connected correctly. Cycling Bluetooth on/off on the phone sometimes fixes this. Usually it takes 2-3 on/off cycles for the music browsing to be fixed.  Depending on the most recent music player the phone was using, sometimes music cannot be played until selecting a different player on the phone first.
Amount of scratches on windshield appeared to be from a car at least a year old when the car was delivered
Soft touch plastic on door panel scuffs easily. Not sure what caused the scuff
: The weather stripping around the doors has come off.
It may be that the system does not understand my pronunciation of words .
: Blue Tooth occasionally does not connect.  Only had to re-pair once.
rubs out
: I love the audio system but it will randomly shut off when i am driving and restart itself. It hasn't happened often enough for me to take it to a dealer yet. It has only occurred about 3 times.
Clips could not move along the track
Issue with front brake pads and rotors
It can be difficult to use the brake pedal without hitting the gas pedal
The clock and outside temperature  are poorly located and too smell
It's in the rear of the center condole
The navigation system directs me to locations miles from the one entered
The front door storage is awkwardly divided in two.
The smell was stronger at first and is less now .  I wondered if the chemical smell was from a cleaning solution.
: The auto hatch opening  is difficult to use. Have to wave foot several times before it opens. I often just use the manual latch
: The car locked me out a couple times. I could hear the lock mechanism trying to work, but it wouldn't unlock. I walked away for 15-20 seconds came back and it opened up fine. It's happened a couple times. We will be addressing this at our upcoming Encore appointment
I was unable to connect the ""Apple Car Play"" feature. I worked, briefly, with the dealer and we need to make an appointment to take the car in to have it checked out
It was difficult to know how to adjust the location to direct the fan  and also to change to heat from AC. Once we read the book and tried, it was easier.
touchless"" foot operation is inconsistent
Does not consistently remotely open or close with foot motion. Dealer explained but just not consistent and seems to lag when it does work.
Have not used voice commands for any function other than navigation. I am not impressed with either its ability to understand or provide accurate responses to voice commands.
I have both an iPod and an iPhone, The system doesn't seem to differentiate between the two and treats the iPod like a phone. Additionally, it doesn't seem to be able to retain both my iPhone and my wife's iPhone information. We have to pair them both almost every time we get into the car.
The system does not respond well to verbal inputs or attempting to write on the knob.
The system is too quick in some of its predictive responses and once it has made the decision for me, it's difficult to undo.
see previous comment - 3-4 page back, which describes our difficulty on our longest road trip to date. : When we were traveling South and temps outside reached 90 degrees, the air-conditioning unit stopped cooling.  We did stop in Savannah, GA and had a BMW dealer/tech check it out.   They told us since it was a brand new 2017 car that they did not have the equipment to determine what was wrong with our particular unit.  When we drove back from Savannah the AC seemed to work when we needed it 
When you click the button to open the rear hatch the hatch does not open fully. I have to pull it up manually the rest of the way. I have not taken it in to get looked at yet.
: The sunroof stopped working for several days. It began working just before I took it to the dealer. The dealership checked it and said that it had ""lost initialization.""
The headliner was peeling near the sunroof.
the warning light should be on the mirror glass
: Poor bass, sound quality
When placed on automatic, the wipers have a mind of their own. Sometimes they are fine but other times they go super fast, even if I am driving slowly and it's barely drizzling. Other times they hardly move, or move and stick, even when it is pouring. It's fine when I turn them to ON but it would be nice if they worked on automatic. Like everything else, it has been in but nothing apparently happens at the dealer, this is must not happen I shared video but that didn't matter either.
: The car does not always shut off. I will hit the button twice but the engine remains running. This is an intermittent problem but annoying. I was told this was an issue with the 2016 Minis but that if had been resolved. Not on my car it wasn't.
It's horrible! There must be a short or something because when I use my phone, the static is awful. I'm just told it doesn't happen there, at Mini, so there is nothing they can do.
Voice command often misinterprets what I say and the volume goes way down, without me turning it down. Add in the static and it's a lot of fun! ?¬†???‚îº
The voice command has a very difficult time understanding commands and I often have to repeat several times. I will say something simple, like ""phone book"" and it will not understand. I then have to go through it numerous times, with it responding with random things that aren't even close to what I said. I always speak clearly and directly but it doesn't always matter.  Also, when I use it for directions, at some point the volume goes WAY down, to the point where I simply cannot hear it and everyone in the car has to sit silently, trying to hear it.
Sometimes the car dings, to remind me that the belt needs to be fastened. The only problem is, the belt is fastened already I throw everything off of the passenger seat, even though it is just. A purse and shouldn't cause this problem, but it persists until I pull over and either place it in park and start over, or turn the vehicle off and then turn it back on.
It is difficult to get cups in the holder, and when I turn the car off, my fingers always hit against the lid of the cup, leaving me with scratches on my fingers. It's a horrible location for a cup holder.
The computer is quite different from actual consumption. It will say I have approx 360 miles when the tank is full but then I watch as I drive and it doesn't work out that way. I am lucky to get 300 miles from a tank of gas and what the computer says I have is not even close to what I actually have, if that makes sense. I understand that a small discrepancy is normal but not 100 miles. On one tank, it said 420 mikes and I didn't even get to 305. I am a very easy driver, so I am not pushing the car, and I use the best gas.
1dent on hood
There are 2 sun visors on the driver's side. The one on the side cannot be lowered because my seat headrest hits the visor before it can lower. I can't push the seat back because I am 5'3"" and I need it where it is.
Small dent on drivers side door noticed at delivery
Small scratch incurred when mailbox door made contact with drivers door however it was deep enough that you could see the white/silver metal below the paint.  I was surprized that such a slight contact with the mailbox door could cause such a deep scratch as the car was stationary at the time and there was no force.  I also purchased the paint protection  and this did not help.
The signal for the HD radio goes in and out inconsistently.
Tilt of the glove box means that items slide out of the glove box and on to the floor when the door is open.
Car pulls to the right when driving.
Seats are white leather which easily allows dye from clothing to fade on to seats...especially from blue jeans.
it doesn't always recognize my voice and the maps navigation voice never connects to bluetooth for some reason?
The apple play just stopped working. When it did work, it was very inconsistent at connecting. Sometimes it connected, but most of the time it failed. I just stopped trying. What a disappointment.
Passenger seat head rest just started rattles
video system locked up completely. Still locked up after turning off car and restarting. Found the fix by googling the problem.
sounds like a distorted or loose speaker in rear cargo area. Will take back to dealership soon
doesnt understand my verbal commands for searching contacts and calling
: Functionality of an MP3 device with the vehicle. The vehicle recognizes the device but I am unable to play any songs from it while connecting through the USB port. It is an older iPod.
Intermittently, I have been unable to access the music from my iPhone.  The songs are listed, but cannot be accessed when highlighted.   This happens every now and then....not always.  And the phone, contacts, etc have always been operational....so it seems to be an issue isolated to the music.
The Navigation System is a highly sophisticated one, so I am still learning all the features, etc.  I have owned my BMW for only 3 months so I need more time to be comfortable with the system.  I have addressed specific questions with the dealership.
: Amount of heat generated at foot level seems low compared to other cars I have owned.   Does not seem broken but works as designed.  Design is deficient for cold climates
Having problems downloading the music from my collection on my X.3 and downloading it onto the X5.
: Seats and armrest get dirty very fast because of the coloring.
Water bottles fall and are unstable in the backseat in the center consul
The leather on the headrest is loose and almost baggy
Carpet won't stay in place.  Moves and bunches up.
I have given up on the voice commands. I was familiar with the system when I had my VW and had to sometimes enunciate slowly, but this system routinely completes the wrong command or nothing at all. I have actually given up on using it and find it largely ineffective.
Our back seat appears to have melted or distorted from normal wear and tear less than six months into the purchase. Cannot wipe or adjust-- disappointing for such a new vehicle.  Ratcheting the seat up and down appears confusing. Sometimes I deal with ""as is placement.""
The headrests have to be adjusted before motoring. It's very difficult to adjust if you are uncomfortable while driving.
: The back seat -- seems to have melted or created a raised pock mark that I cannot wipe clean. Just from being in the sun? Normal parked not in extreme or adverse conditions. Disappointing blemish after such a short time of ownership. Bought 12/20/2016. Did not appear that it could be fixed or reconditioned. Have been somewhat disappointed by this ""leather"" grade.: Still focused on the distorting or pock in the back seat-- almost seems to have melted or distorted. Seats feel cheap and the leather / vinyl grade seems poor and does not seem to be in the same class as the overall vehicle.
The back seat appears to have melted/ distorted in a spot. Cannot wipe clean or manipulate. Do not understand why it has distorted so easily. Parked in normal not adverse conditions. : Still focused on the distorting or pock in the back seat-- almost seems to have melted or distorted. Seats feel cheap and the leather / vinyl grade seems poor and does not seem to be in the same class as the overall vehicle.
The plastic and door frame are easily soiled or scuffed by every day dirt and contact with shoes or grocery bags, etc. Have been able to wipe, but I anticipate a more permanent mark at some point. It doesn't seem like it could be repaired or explained-- just seems to be characteristic to the materials/ wear and tear.
Repeatedly received the ""drivetrain malfunction"" / check engine notice. The warning will not fire for days and then go off every day. Have reported to the dealer. Have gotten poor  response. Last time they indicated that they could not get the problem to repeat, so they ""did nothing."" Called and let them know that I was still concerned about it due to an upcoming 1500 mile road trip and got little to no follow up. Not sure what is wrong with the car. Have used the internal checks and they indicate that it's OK. Biggest headache with the car/ makes me nervous because it's so new. Will be a big factor in whether or not we buy out the lease if this continues to occur without a dealer fix or explanation and/or if the functionality of the car becomes a reliability issue. : Repeated ""drivetrain malfunctions"" that the dealer cannot explain and seems overly casual about. Received first warning within a week or two of delivery and subsequent warnings. Last time I took it into the dealer they ignored the problem because they could ""not reproduce it."": I routinely receive a message: ""drivetrain malfunction-- drive moderately. Maximum drivetrain output not available. Consult service center. I have brought this into the shop within a week of taking delivery. They indicated that a rodent ate an important wire and replaced. Then it happened again-- they changed the oil and fixed some update/bugs. Then I called again because problem persisted-- they indicated that they could not replicate the problem and ""did nothing."" This has been very concerning and the main and repeated problem that we have had with the vehicle during the first 5000 miles of travel. This has been a major disappointment. The dealer is very casual about this and it often takes weeks to get an appointment for a fix at the Austin, Texas dealership. It concerns me to drive around with this sort of warning being displayed on the regular and also to have no dealer explanation.
I have noticed this occasionally on the highway when we are looking for power and sometimes in stop and go traffic. Sometimes the mileage is very inconsistent. Seems to resolve so I haven't gone to the dealer.
I discovered that the plastic trim around the sunroof opening was at fault. I lubricated the trim and the noise went away.
: The tire pressure monitoring system states that it is low in all four tires, so i air it up, and I also take it to discount tire, and they put the correct amount of air in, and the warning is still on.
There is a rectangular metal piece that lays horizontally covering the top of the steering column. Under certain conditions while driving over VERY rough roads it can create a metallic rattle against the part it lays on. The sound can also be reproduced while the vehicle is not in motion if the driver taps on the piece with a finger.
Difficult to use foot sensor for trunk; prefer a way to unlock passenger side door before getting into vehicle.
Difficult to initiate auto low beam option
: the car had a scratch on the rear left panel above wheel well.
the convertible roof had a horrible creaking noise coming from the drivers side rear corner where the roof meets the body.  After a week at the dealer, they ended up inserting a bunch of felt and noise is much better ...
At delivery drivers side front headlight did not work. Left car at dealer overnight to be repaired.
Drops out and one needs to go to settings to reconnect
When it is set to a particular driver, it does not follow the setting. As I understand, each driver has its own key and it is set with its own seat memory.  Even though when choosing a driver's setting, it still recognize the last driver's setting.
There were scratches on the center wood paneling and we immediately informed our sales rep and genius rep.  The car was sent to the detailed dept and was told they could not do anything about it.  I believe they did try to polish it off but it did not work.
When at  stop, the noise will initially sound then stops and continues.  We had the same noise with our old 5 series.
Can hear a vibration from the rear end when at idle. Could not figure out which location.
When i took it to the dealership they told me it was probably a fuse that got burnt out.
Difficulty with address. Searching points of interest near by like ""where is the nearest starbucks."" Doesnt red last text message received or doesnt send text message with voice command.
I would state an address for navigation and it would constantly change the radio
My phone wont connect with the bluetooth sometimes. The apps won't load properly i.e. Music, Pandora, etc.
Won't pop open
Can't figure out intermittent
Trunk unlocks but doesn't pop open
Random button to the left
Sometimes can't get radio to turn off when leaving vehicle
: Nav is crazy Radio is crazy Back up is confusing almost to the point of being useless
: Nav is crazy Radio is crazy Back up is confusing almost to the point of being useless
I expected brakes to respond better. Need to break hard to stop sooner. Not smooth but will stop.
Doors could use more ""stops"" and additional interior handles to control opening to avoid dinging parked car doors.
Wind noise seems to come from leading edge of front doors.
Brake dust occurs immediately after washing wheels AND wheels are HARD to clean completely
Loose wire for compass and rattle, both fixed at 1200 mile service.
Wheels constantly need cleaning.
The car's exterior paint chips easily from road debris; it is also easily scratched
Compared to other vehicles the wind/road noise is higher with this vehicle even though the seals seem to be in good repair.
Its ridiculous
The Center Arm rest has a storage compartment that is awkward to access, provides little storage .
Currently getting about 17mpg, with mostly city driving.  I have only reached 1,300 miles, however, and have been told that the fuel efficiency may be low in the break-in period.
Entertainment system switches to Pandora setting by itself often causing me to reset to the entertainment previously selected by me.
Wood grain Covering  has bubble.
Tow hook plate missing, part was ordered2 months ago but i haven't received it yet
I didn't pay to much attention because I thought it does it because it is new
When I turn all the way in reverse the tire kind of jumps makes noice
The view is somewhat distorted in terms of making items seem much farther away than they actually are.  The green and red lines are helpful but not self explanatory.
Seat belt gets twisted when retracted and caught making it difficult to pull out.  This has happened several times.
Pulling the hood release TWICE is a strange and uncomfortable release.
The car has 4000 miles and is about three months old. The seat is showing wear.
The air is not cold to the temperature degree
I am short and a senior.  I cannot use the trunk at all because I cannot close the hatch myself.  My former Toyotas although much larger cars, did not present this problem.
Headrest too high and I cannot lower
: Passenger front  door vibrates or rattles when driving
Handbrake difficult to use when arm rest is down.
Felt there was too much 'play'. May have been my 'driving' technque. Problem has resolved since I adjusted  distance between seat and clutch .
: Left sun visor above door does not extend far enough towards the back of the door to effectively block the sun.The right side has no sun visor, it needs one.
Overwhelming
If the engine is cold, the brakes are noisy. In cold weather, or snow or ice is present, the rear brakes grind sometimes.
They are not easy to reach or find.
The estimated mgp for my model is 28 in the city. It seems the average has been closer to 22.
The seat recline handle is at the rear of the seat and is often confused with the seat height adjustment handle.
Cannot move to a high enough position to allow me to see using the rearview mirror.
Because I am short my drivers seat is positioned close to the floor pedals which means it is a long reach to grasp the seatbeat when reaching to put it on.
scraped the bumper of another car
: all the radio presets disappeared. Thought it was the second less used key fob, but it has not happened since
I returned to the dealership regarding this issue and was told that since I don't have an iPhone. I probably would have connectivity issues!
: The painting job for my 2017 mini is not great compared to the 2016 mini.
don't use voice command because it doesn't work wel
issues like while switching between iphones, sometimes media is not playing until switch to radio then back to another iphone/ipod. Sometime it takes a while to playing music via blue tooth
: Windshield wipers sweek sometimes... Have not been able to determine the specific parameters in which it happens but it's quite annoying when it does.
There has been a rattle inside the car but have been unable to determine the origin. Came & went for about a week but seems to have stopped for now.
Scratches and blemishes from the factory.  As well as left over residue from shipping protective coating
It may be more of a steering sensitivity as opposed to pulling but since it doesn't do it to the right I'm characterizing it as pull. It often happens while navigating a curve wherein the car wants to drift to the left. While driving straight it does not drift.
at this point, I have no idea how to adjust the headrests...it is not intuitive. Do not see an automatic control, and have not dared to force manually.
when i turn off ac, it won't turn off
. : vented air switches to Air Conditioning !!!
i have yet to get heat!
the wooden trim finish, scratches too easily the trunk / cargo ledge also scratches too easily
It cannot understand my voice. Was great with salesman
Occasionally fails to understand locations. Occasionally fails to select the right location . : Audio link with iPhone and Android devices sometimes blurs the voice call, so I need to redial. If this happens, it happens right at the beginning of the voice call and thankfully not during a phone call.
After driving and stopping a few times the sound goes away.
: A PLASTIC PIECE USED FOR CHILD SEAT RESTRAINTS BROKE AND FELL INTO ITS OWN HOUSING AND CANNOT BE RETRIEVED
The design of this area is not the best. Not easy to take out stuff from it
Cup Holder area is limited and feels very compact
I inserted a foam cup into the holder and upon extraction it punctured the cup and liquid leaked filling the holder.  The 'tension' bars inside the holder are too sharp.
: Poor design of cup holder
when button its pushed both driver side and passenger side on cold wheather only they remain pushed until the vehicule temperature reaches 70 degres f , so this is happening only when its cold in the morning .
: recilculating button doesnt stay on . i press the button like before im entering a tunel or if im on the back of a diesel truck and the button stayed on for maximum 45 seconds
at 3000 miles i have to add one quart of coolant
: The rear latch does not 'see' my foot when I try to do the kick motion to open it. It only works about once every 6 tries, so I don't bother using it. Frustrating.
: The back up camera does not work when starting up when it is cold. Seems to require warming up to operate. Because of this, I can't rely on it when backing out of my driveway in the morning.
Vehicle is susceptible to high wind at highway speeds, causes the vehicle to vibrate or shake
It was more difficult than expected to program the lane lines on the back up camera display
We battle with the memory settings for two drivers. Mirrors and seat do not always seem to respond to the specified driver
Low power AC does not cool adequately. Excessive fan noise with max AC and defrost. Was very challenging to figure out all of the steps to get adequate climate control. Our last luxury car was easy, this one is complicated with many steps that needed to be learned to get it right
Pushing defrost button causes loud fan to come on 'high' and noisy. Same with max AC
There were too many steps to teach ourselves before we started getting the climate control to work to our satisfaction. Was not easy like pushing the auto button in our last luxury car
During a 2 hour road trip the front tow cover fell out and the adjacent sensor fell behind the bumper, which caused the sensor to constantly go off when stopped or moving slowly . Nothing memorable happened during that 2 hour drive that would have caused the cover to fall off and the sensor to fall out of place. It just happened.
Possible to push brake and gas pedals simultaneously
can't get apple car play to connect
the trunk does not open easily with kicking under or using key
we had roof rails installed with factory ski rack. the ski racks are very hard to close/use. not at all happy with them.
after we picked up the car we noticed a whistling sound coming from ski racks
the automatic driver side door does not always work with hand sensor. The kick under car does not always work to open trunk.
not used to the camera. beeps constantly when parked or too close to another car. we live in the city. we are always close to another car.
The only way to achieve an increase in temp is to first activate the front window defrost, then to decrease fan speed.
The apple play do not make calls reliable or receive calls. : Once or twice a week. Phone will not sync. Can't make calls. Won't read texts
: Every time when I start the engine, the heating/cooling system is on. I was told that if I turn off the heating/cooling system before I turn off the engine, then the next time when I turn on the engine, the heating/cooling system should not on. But it seems not the case.
: SOS malfunction light on the dash.  Had to order new sensor.
Try to enter an address for navigation while driving and the system doesn't understand what I am trying to do.
Very complicated and the factory navigation and the apple car play navigation interfere with each other and are difficult to use and understand. very frustrating while driving.
Phone often has not paired correctly several times. I had to 'forget' the Bluetooth pairing on my phone and repair the device to get it working. Also, once paired the audio system automatically starts Pandora radio on my phone  so I have had to disable the 'Cellular Data use' on my phone for the Pandora app.
The middle head rest in the second row was stuck in the locked position and it took a lot of maneuvering to get it to release. Also, the headrest appears to be missing 'teeth' to allow it to adjust to different heights.
The blemish was on the passenger side of the car. The service Dept. reacted promptly when notified. The windshield was replaced.
I will take to dealer when regular maintenance is due
wipers are very hard to work and understand.
stays loose and then get caught in door when removed
Suppose to open with foot and no one can seem to get it to work. I just use the fob.
Address loaded took me to wrong location
Nappa leather scratches very easy. Had cut in console  and fixed the passenger scuff mark.
The car has skinny tires and tend to crab walk side to side in winding conditions or with road that are uneven
: About once a week I am given a warning that the trunk door is open. Its odd because I rarely use the back trunk door and when I do I know that I close it properly. The backup camera will not work unless the trunk door is completely shut. When I check the trunk door it is always shut but the system says otherwise.
I've tried using this feature and could not figure it out.
When you unbuckle 50% of the time the seatbelt does not retract correctly . Often times it gets stuck when trying to pull the seat belt. You need to unfold the top part of the seat belt which can be difficult with the angle 
: Using manual trunk release on the trunk, the hatch does not always open complexly.
After trying to pronumciat clearly several times, I give up and input manually.

Takes along time for back window to clear
No easy release for center console
: Bluetooth pairing control inop from device vs vehicle controls. Must initiate music playing from device and utilize controls on device vs using controls in vehicle to skip songs or navigate through playlists. This is experienced using an iPhone6 ios8 issue is intermittent and is affected more by using shuffle command in music library
When I play videos on my phone through Bluetooth, many times the audio and visual are not synchronized.
The unpleasant smell is not anything out of the ordinary. It's the 'new car smell' that was very strong and unpleasant. Off-gassing of the toxic VOCs are nauseating. After a month or two of driving with the windows down whenever possible, the smell has diminished.
: Blind spot indicator some times does not turn on.
Dust is stucking in Brake shileld and making noise in lower speed
Located under armrest where there is little room
Simply does not appear to recognize the commands given.
Has phone charging station which will not charge an iPhone. Poor use of limited space
When reversing out of garage in the morning, front breaks squeal. After car warms up, problem goes away.
: Garage door opener would not pair with vehicle
It lost bluetooth pairing with an iphone
Not a well sound proofed vehicle.  Generally quite loud when on the highway.
See previous comment.
Once the hood is unlocked is difficult to locate the safety latch to fully open the hood.
Paasenger side mirror signal ligth not working. Noticed this about 1 week ago.
Will repeatly ask for commands, names or numbers to be repeated & after a few trials, it will disengage . I just gave up on using voice command.
USE WINDSHIELD WIPERS
Rattling noise much like tin cans trailing behind a 'newly wed car'. Typically occurs at low to moderate speeds when driving straight. Suspect pebbles getting caught between brake assembly and dust shield.
: Not fully compatible with Android + Spotify
Poor seat and head clearance. Seat when slid fully forward will hit sun shade when inclined. May potentially damage sun shade and seat.
Lurches in low gear ratios when applying more gas. Seems to be a hunting issue between sensors and automatic throttling features.
Tan seats have blue tint from wearing blue jeans.
Glove box drivers side hangs down @1/4 inch from the proper position. I will address at the 1200 mile service next month
Spot on driver's door where it must have opened into something before delovery
Dealer/salesman was to have touched up that spot on door but on 1st appointment, I cancelled because of snow and dealer never scheduled another appontment
Don't know how to put wipers on intermittent
Very infrequent 'soda-can crunch' sound at very low speed.
: Static noise with my iPhone.
M Performance Exhaust has an intermittent rattle.
Usually found on drivers armrest not the dashboard.
: heat adjusted on passenger side  only works on two settings
: heat adjustment  on passenger side
: Navigation often not up-to-date with current traffic
The automatic foot control to open the back does not work! The button to close the back with the locking symbol does not work!
Not sure if I've turned it on successfully. The switch is set too deep into the wheel and although it does light when it is engaged you can't see it. Truthfully, it is dangerous because you really have to manuever to take a look.
It works and then it doesn't work.
I bought my car in the winter ,so while driving the rear windows will fog up and form ice inside on both the rear side windows.
Difficult to maintain a comfortable temperature setting.
Frequently does not work so calls are missed when in car
Hard to know if it is working
Fob button very odd, I'm not even surr how to opperate it, do you hold then pull the door?
: Passenger Seatbelts warning although no one is seated
Eventually resolved when I shut down the phone and delete my phone from the Bluetooth and delete the link to the car from my phone and reestablish the connection from scratch.
When driving the seatbelt will sometimes randomly lock up when foot isn't near the break nor has anything provoked it to lock up.
Dirt easily gets trapped in the seats and is hard to vacuum or wipe out of seat
I believe its the rear hatchback.  the hatchback is large enough that its hard to restrain when the car goes over bumps, pot holes and rough roads. the hatchback moves against the rubber and squeekes.
Setup the radio but don't know how to use it no place to make changes
I've owned multiple 3 series 2014-2017 all have the same creak sounding from the doors.
fuel pump relay clicks when unlocking vehicle.
Worse than my 2013 VW
Manual speed settings difficult to access in heavyy storms
Pushing central unlock button every time egress is required is annoying
It took me three weeks to figure out intermittent wiper settings.  Also, intermittent wipers seem to shut off after 5-10 minutes.
: Driver side exterior mirror has slight but perceptible distortion.
Sometimes entering console button progresses to next menu item, other times it adds letter or number.
Seat configuration for tall person like me  is limited.
Rotating selection through 'feet only', 'feet and windshield', 'middle and windshield' is clumsy because you have to cycle through each level in sequence to get to desired option.  Button is small and feedback ' is small.  So adjusting setting while driving takes concentration on display and distracts from paying attention to road.
This is an intermittent problem
I've had to have the rear driver side tire replaced  no explanation by dealer of why tire was so damaged it had to be replaced - now having issues again with same tire - losing air- need to take it in again!  Only in month 3 of ownership and expect these tires would be more reliable
You kick under where the manual says the sensor is, with the key in my pocket and the trunk still doesn't open.  Many times i have just resorted to using the FOB to open the trunk.
I press on the same spot to open the gas tank and sometimes i can't open it.
: 2 sensors were defective. My car alarm would go off without anything being near is or immediately after locking the car. and a front parking sensor was going off giving me an alert in the car.
2 sensors were defective. My car alarm would go off without anything being near is or immediately after locking the car. and a front parking sensor was going off giving me an alert in the car.
It is hard to operate the settings without moving the other seat settings.
The faux letter material soils easily and stains are hard to remove.
It seems like the ac compressor is not enough to cool down the car in a warm day.
AC is very weak to cool down the vehicle but when I crank it up, the engine doesn't respond when accelerating and takes a while to get up to speed.
brakes are too soft.
: Transmission can be clunky at times from zero to acceleration. Vehicle jerk at times after stopping at a light.
: Transmission can be clunky at times from zero to acceleration. Vehicle jerk at times after stopping at a light.
Liftgate would not close when pressing switch on the dash. Had to manually close.
The fan is very loud.
Impossible to hear a conversation at highway speeds. Nosiest vehicle I can ever remember driving.
Brakes are very 'twitchy' and hard to apply measured pressure.
I didn't even know I have them!
Phone paired at delivery but no longer works.
It was explained to me at delivery but I still find it intimidating.
The front seats are very short and thigh support suffers
It's winter and the windshield was covered on ice a couple times. The problem I have is that it took me about 30 minutes to defrost the windshield. The fans are too small and the hot hair can't get out faster you can barely feel the air coming out. Also, the inside temperature can only reach up to 84 F which in the winter is not a good thing.
It does not match the street names I am saying very well... And with locations likelyhood of a hit is even lower
Just would have expected a better visor in a car this expensive. The sun visor seems like it came out of an economy car. does not exude BMW quality.
They are advertised as roof rails but because they are attached along the entire length of the roof without a break it's impossible to tie or clip anything to them. They're just ornamental, which is sort of dumb.
Compared to my Honda Pilot, a much larger car, I need to stomp the brakes harder to stop the BMW. It took me a few weeks to adjust but I don't notice it now.
The passenger seat grew extremely hot due to what I believe was a faulty sensor. I returned it to the dealer and they pulled the seat. : The heating sensor in one of the seats appeared defective, and the seat grew very hot.
It's like sitting on a folding chair with a pillow.
: I ordered the car with the faux leather interior. It is icy in the winter and roasting in the sun. I need gloves to use the steering wheel in the morning on a cold day, and it takes awhile for the car interior to heat up. Again, my larger Pilot had a much more efficient climate control system.
Too much spring tension.
: Engine hesitation on acceleration
very unconfortable.
When I open the hatch, a lot of times it will just stop and not open all the way.
I will be taking the car up to the dealers Monday for this problem
when I drive I hear to much wind nose from the outside
: Temperature setting seems to be inaccurate, i.e. set automatic temp at 68 and it seems much warmer so set it at 64 which is inconsistent with previous model
fogging of front lights.
I don't how to elaborate on this...I have to start over too often
scratch found on the door after first pick up
As mentioned, the release is a little hard to reach, causing a minor strain. : It is a minor complaint, though it would be beneficial if the seat belt receptacle was a little more extended out of the seat, thus making the connection less of a strain.  Otherwise, I am truly impressed with the vehicle.
The paint is so thin when you try to use touch-up paint it leaves a dimple. The paint chips are so thin you cannot fill any uneven paint. Thats how thin it is. : Thin paint, chipping and road noise.
I talked to my salesman about it and they will check it out when I take it in for service : Thin paint, chipping and road noise.
gets the wrong name and numbers  My last 2 cars were the same problems
It keeps dropping the 2nd phone off
seat belt latch is down to low.  Its hard to latch the seat belt because the seat and console are to close together. If the seat belt latch was higher it would be alright.
noise is on the passenger side.
I don't think it is accurate
Just doesn't seem to be accurate
audio does not return to the sound system even after phone call is done
Running boards are too narrow and therefore useless. When wet they are slick especially with the rounded over edge which allows your shoe to easily slip off the board.
Steering is very loose with no road feel. Wheel does not self center and requires turning input from drive to return to center. Dealer says this is normal for electric steering system. I FIND THIS VERY DANGEROUS AS CAR DOES NOT RETURN TO CENTER POSITIN AUTOMATICALLY
Turn signal is molded from two pieces of plastic. Where the two pieces meet is where you would put your finger to actuate the turn signal, it very sharp and should be redesigned or at least break the sharp edges of the plastic so it is not so sharp. Have not taken to dealer because it appears there is nothing they can do for this without ruining the appearance of the turn signal.
When seat changes from driver 1 to driver 2 preset or vise versa there is noticeable clunking when the seat moves forward and reserve
Shared previously - but it doesn't work most of the time.
Two issues:  1.  We cannot consistently open the trunk with the foot motion.  Perhaps 25% of the time we can get it to open, it has become something of a game in the family. 2.  The unlock button being in the middle of the console makes it very inconvenient when you want to unlock the car.  I do like to keep the other three doors locked most of the time so someone doesn't jump in at a gas station but when I do want to unlock it - I would prefer to have it on my door vs in the middle.
When I have tried to go from the radio to Bluetooth - Audible - it seems very difficult - sometimes it works right away and others it's 15 minutes of trial and error.  I gave up and just used the AUX cable. Also - deleting favorite channels and 'saved' music should be easier.
I am very short - 5 foot tall and the shoulder strap tends to rub against my neck - it would be nice if the strap at the door frame would slide downward, as it is stationary now.
i have the iPhone package. connection is inconsistent. sometimes works fine, other times takes 15 min of turning phone and connections on and off to connect. very frustrating. if i am on a call before i get into the car and want to connect while on car to the apple system, that seems impossible.
circular control nob to right of auto transmission stick has overheated a couple times.
i have AC seats. the passenger seat makes a whistling sound when the AC seat is engaged
system options seem to be redundant, auto control doesn't heat car fast enough. too many options to cool/heat. also get a whistling sound on passenger side sometimes which i need to address with BMW service.
Cannot understand screen controls work. Apple car play is impossible to understand
Menus difficult
Controls for media very difficult to understand
Impossible to understand
Can't locate
Menus impossible to navigate
Menus controls very difficult
Will not stay in preset
: Memory doesn't always work
Don't always memorize
This appears to be a problem with the car.  Mentioned to dealer, but told they are all like that!
I found the various icons difficult to understand, to know what direction the stalk went for the front and rear wipers, when it went up or down and how many clicks, what the button on the end of the stalk did, how to use the delay function and increase or decrease the time of the delay, especially the delay on the rear wiper. It's not much different than on my 2007 X5, but just different enough to be confusing.
The collision avoidance/alert system light shows up in a location that is totally obscured by the steering wheel in my direct line of vision. I cannot see it when it lights up.
I need the actual HUD to show just a little further to the right on the windshield than it will currently display.
The button is very small and is in an unusual location that can't be seen from the normal driver's perspective. You have to literally bend over in your seat and put your head down around the steering wheel to spot the control button the first time. Once you know where it is, you can find it more easily, but you still have to feel around for it.
The controls are difficult to find by feel while seated, and don't seem intuitive. Even my salesman had a difficult time finding the right control and showing me how to use it while we were both standing outside the car looking at the seat from the side.
Buckle catch and release mechanism is too far rearward and too close to the seat to easily reach comfortably. If it were just a bit forward and a bit further away from the seat when the tension was released, it would be easier to grasp and release the buckle.
The bottom seat cushion is not very comfortable on longer trips. After having the car just a couple of weeks, I took a 300 mile trip. With one fuel stop along the way, my rear end was very sore by the end of the drive to our destination. It just didn't seem like there was sufficient padding in the right places for a man of my stature .
Voice recognition commands does not work very well with my accent. Apple Car Play works very well and never have a problem,. I use Apple Car Play.
sometimes it disconnects, or when I get in the car it doesn't automatically connect.
trunk either doesn't close all the way  or the key-fob triggers the trunk release while it's in my pocket. I haven't figured out what the actual problem is yet. : Trunk doesn't close every time. I think it's because it weighs so little, and because the air pressure stops it from closing. Either that or the trunk release on my key fob causes it to unlatch. Not 100% sure, but I've had to pull over to 'reclose' the trunk several times. Including some times back to back.
The electric car doesn't have a gas engine, so the difference between ""on"" and ""accessory mode"" is hard to perceive. Parking the car and hitting the ""on/off"" button sometimes stops the car and other times puts it in accessory mode. I think pressing the break may have a factor in it - but it feels inconsistent.
Extremely limited console storage
Errors reporting battery or charge status : Errors in reporting battery or charging status
Menu structure is confusing
They are suicide doors and are tight to use in a standard spot. Plus people in the back are trapped until someone releases them from the outside.
Have not be able to make it work.
Bad location in center console. Hard to insert cables.
The low beams are LED and very bright.  The high beams are halogen, the distance covered isn't very far and the beam displacement isn't very even.  There are dark spots in some areas and bright spots in others.  With current technology and the price of the car I don't think the high beams on this car are adequate.
poor position through steering wheel
: The hands free trunk open/close doesn't always work
: Passenger seatbelt malfunction
Navigation sometimes takes me to the wrong location. Alot of times doesn't even understand where I am trying to go. I think it needs an update but dealer told me it has the lastest software installed.
I have issues paring it with my andriod. IPhone only has happend ones or twice.
: audio, comminication,entertainment system went completely dead - made an appointment with the dealer to fix problem,however the problem fixed itself before the scheduled appointment. and has not happened since.
Turn signal is too sensitive, barely moving it to turn off makes the signal display other direction instead of turning it off. This annoying feature was also on prior year BMWs.
don't understand how it works
The USB port is in the middle glove compartment which locates it in a far away location if the driver has his/her phone in another location while driving.
Noticed a shimmy in car that increased as speed increased. : Shimmy noted previously. Was tire related.
I have not been able to figure out how the automatic wiper settings work. I find the drivers manual lacking in many areas such as this
See above
The only cup holder is in the front which is rare and not convenient for a 4-5 passenger car. The holder in the front is built into the console under the dashboard which is a terrible location in the first place. The holder is too small to fit most cups/glasses etc and very difficult to remove as there is very little room between the cup top and dash. Very poorly conceived and designed.
on the left side of the steering colomn behind steering wheel.
memory buttons too low
: There is no way to unlock the passenger door from the drivers side except leaning over the consul and with your seat belt on, that is almost impossible. The 'Genius' at Hendrick BMW said that it could be resolved by resetting the computer to unlock both doors at the same time. That lasted one day.
It was a tiny area  at the bottom of the front lip where the paint had probably bubbled at application and then been touched after it hardened. It's something you could only see by getting low/close, but it came up immediately when the salesman and I did the new owner walkaround. We both noticed it right away.
I hesitate to even bring this up as a 'flaw,' as it's clearly a decision BMW has made in the interest of cost, weight savings, or both. I would just prefer it to be less loud.
Again, I'm assuming this is a case of cost/weight-savings in less sound-deadening material. Also probably not a flaw, as such, just loud.
Over ANY kind of bump or sudden change of fore/aft angle , the rear suspension  makes a creaking noise every time. It definitely sounds like it's coming from the upper portion of the suspension, so my suspicion is it's the bushings. Wouldn't expect that in a new car. Took it to the track recently  and that day didn't make it worse nor 'break things in' so it went away.
: Left side fog lamp activates when headlights are on automatic day/night control.
Frequently does not understand voice commands and makes selections other than desired.
For a car this expensive, the trunk should power open when the release handle is touched.
cameras on the sides of the front fender seem unnecessary.  I would rather have a camera in the front of the car to watch as I approach a barrier   The warning does not sound if I approach one that is low.
I think the problem is the car is connected to my iPhone, so Siri and the BMW voice recognition system clash
: Tire make road noise, BRIDGESTONE run-flats
Stevencreek BMW approached the issue seriously and worked 3 days to locate it and fixed it
When making/receiving calls from the car there is an intermittent issue of the person on the other end of the phone not being able to hear me while I can hear them. When this happens the Radio continues to play as opposed to fading out and having the phone audio be the only audio in the car. I have yet to be able to identify a specific sequence of events that causes this to happen. I have had no issue with the phone, finished a call, had another call come in and then experience the issue during that second call. I assume it is related to apple carplay.
there appears to be a round imperfection in hood paint about 6' diam that you can see under certain lighting conditions. I wonder if it were a handling device at manu. facility that caused this
: the gauge cluster lighting is very very poor in daytime conditions.. i.e get in a darkened area in daylight and you cannot read gauges all that well
The car is designed with small turn signals on the exterior side mirrors.  They are extremely bright and very distracting to a driver trying to survey the surroundings.
: It would be very helpful to have slightly larger sun visors.  Even with them at an optimized position, there is still a lot of room for the evening/morning sun to shine through, blinding the driver.
Again, comparing to my last BMW, the heated steering wheel in this car does not heat up fast enough and it doesn't get nearly as warm as my last car.  I returned to the dealer for a follow-up BMW Q&A and when I brought it up, the guy to,d me that all cars are different.  I will definitely bring it to their attention again when I go in for service.
Blind spot rear passenger- very difficult when I back out
I would prefer that the locks be on the doors themselves rather the the dashboard
BMW will not recognize my older LG phone which annoys me enough that I may not purchase another BMW
Seat belts hard to access
oyster Dakota leather seats picks up color from clothes causing frequent staining. Seats must be cleaned more than normal and not all of the color comes off after cleaning.
It is difficult to turn off the turn signal  without accidentally going too far and turning on the turn signal going the other direction.
All but the top row of heating element work fine.  The top row does not defrost.
Instructions on how to use the system are not clear and difficult to find. Tried to use it once and it hit the car behind me. I may have been using it incorrectly but have no way of knowing without taking it into the dealer.
Only 1 USB port and it is ""upside-down"", so that any short cables I plug in need to be twisted in order for the device to be face-up. The cable breaks/stops working after a long period of being twisted like that.
: When I talk on phone via Bluetooth people comment that it sounds like I'm underwater.
The automatic wipers don't respond correctly to the conditions: they go very fast with very little rain, or they don't wipe at all with heavier rain. This changes frequently to the point that I don't use this feature.
TAKES SEVERAL FOOT SWIPES TO OPEN.
PICKED UP THE CAR IN LATE JAN -- TODAY IS 4/16.  LESS THAN 3 MONTHS?  SHOULDN'T HAPPEN.  INCONVENIENT TO TAKE BACK TO THE DEALER.
: windshield wiper was making noise when used in cold weather.
maybe it's the range of radio station, but I am not sure, on route 200 between montgomary county and 95, there is poor reception most of the time.
voice recognition system
it will be better if the cup holder is more flexible.
I'm not sure if you can really call them side steps, they seem more for visual appeal. Attempting to use will likely result in injury.
: The controls on the doors on the driver side are difficult to use, such as controls for the windows. One has to move their hand far back, beyond allowed space, to reach the controls because they are awkwardly close.
This could be a user error and the lack of advertisement of the feature. I find it difficult at times to understand how the function works, even though it doesn't seem complicated. I found it often for it go back straight instead of curving into the parking spot, requiring me to intervene and stopping the feature. I'm not sure if it's merely trying to straighten out prior to beginning the parking process or merely not working correctly.
In general, typical of many voice systems, requires multiple attempts and doesn't recognize the initial command. Most of the issues I've experienced is with verbal command of the address and it tends to select an incorrect state.
The seat belt itself cannot be adjusted; therefore, it often times runs against the neck resulting in discomfort.
For whatever reason the push release seems to require a special touch.  so instead i just use the FOB or interior release.
The entertainment system is overly complicated compared to our Honda.  It's our 2nd BMW so we are getting used to it but its just not as intuitive.
Just overly complicated
Triec it Hard to use
Does not always work
Does not sense correctly
Hard too use
The screen has three black spots on the screen  Can not see the screen- therefore all broken
The fabric was torn.
The opener only allows it to open a little at a time. Difficult to use
Everything that touches the car - scoffs it. It's maddening
Just the design itself is sub-optimal. Even though your car is unlocked you have to have the keys with you and opening the trunk/latch door takes way more effort than should be needed.
See previous comment
: The auto sensing feature for wind shield wipers is not calibrated properly - it either is too slow or too fast.
The voice command command button on phone doesn't always work on phone
The real-time traffic is not received. : I have a standard navigation system which suppose to have real time traffic; yet it is not working, I am not getting real-time traffic at all. I have visited BMW service center, phone support and my sales person; still can't get it to work.
: Satellite radio suddenly stopped working within first two weeks of ownership. Dealership had to uninstall then reinstall BMW software.
Just very complex and hard to uderstand from usability perspective : complex to understand
Problem with Airplay connectivity.. suddenly stops and then has to be reset.. no warning... very sudden and works for a while between car restarts and then suddenly disappears
takes a while to get auto to work for cooling... the fan does not pickup also automatic A/C light does not come on when on auto and changin temperature controls
: iPhone  does not automatically connect to Bluetooth  vehicle is on
I was informed that at higher speeds increase wind noise is normal and I should not worry about it. The dealer said that they can check it upon next service in case it still persists.
I am still to bring this up to the dealer's attention as this issue has been identified very recently - I have not used the handbrake at all to-date.
Parts of the material looked like it was stained. I have reported it on the same day of car pickup. After returning to the dealer I was informed that 'no car is perfect' and that these are not severe enough markings for them to take action on.
: The cooling of the rear area of the car is not good/intense enough unless A/C is turned to MAX. The vents have decreased venting power outside of the A/C MAX setting.
The wooden panel next to the gear shift is severely visibly scratched. I have reported it to the dealer three times. I was AGAIN informed that 'no car is perfect' but that they will try to polish these scratches out. I am considering going back to the dealer and asking for a complete wooden panel replacement.
I was informed by the dealer that these are normal engine starting sounds which tone down over time. They do go away after the engine runs for roughly 20-30s.
The battery failed completely around two weeks since car delivery. It was replaced by the dealer to a brand new one and marked as faulty.
It's heavy. It would be nice if the trunk lid just popped open.
The first thing we noticed was the chip/scratch on the passenger side. My car was in the showroom. We mentioned it and the salesperson called the body repairman and he came and fixed it right away. The salesperson and repairman were very nice and professional.
The unlock/lock control is in the center of the dashboard so if I need to unlock my passenger door I have to crawl in my driver side to reach the unlock control button. It would be much easier if if the unlock/lock control was on the door.
Poor location. Some of my cups are tall and they are hard to get in and out of holder. The placement is up to close to panel.
I was told most people don't have navigation installed anymore, considering that most people are using maps apps on their phones. So the USB port in the center console is nice, but another one in place of the cigarette lighter would be more appropriate since people will probably have their phones in a phone mount of some sort, which is getting into something else.
The Apple Car Play sometimes causes connectivity issues whereby I cannot disconnect a call
: The trunk lid popped up while driving. The incident happened twice.
Shifter interferes with large cups
: After I am on the phone via blue tooth for a few minutes, I hear a very large thump come through my speakers, loud enough that it makes me jump everytime it happens.  I believe it happens on every Bluetooth enabled phone call.
I asked for heavy duty plastic instead of carpet, the carpet ones are cheap and do not help with snow and rain.
I can see scuff marks on the inside lower part of the door, must be from my shoes, even though I try very hard not to touch the doors with my shoes.
As discussed above,  after the failure of the central control module, the repair was supposed to eliminate the problem. When I received the car back, I was told that the technician checked the local AM stations, and it was fine. However, the static continues. My previous 4  leased BMW cars never had this problem.
: Central control module malfunction. Problem with the radio tuner , and emergency contact number, BMW Assist not working, and engine starting. Required 10 days to replace, as initial replacement still did not work. Additionally, static was reported on the AM radio stations when the car was returned to the dealership. I was told that the new module would resolve this problem. Unfortunately, it did not. I will have to bring the car in again, or wait for the first 8,000 mile checkup.
Requires caution when entering and exiting the car in order not to scuff the door panels, or rub shoes or boots on the lower panels. Difficult to clean.
it doesn't understand location names like Red Lobster. It only seems to understand street addresses
Trunk is supposed to open with foot motion however this function works sporadically.  To close trunk lid requires a pull down and slam. I miss the automatic close button that was on my previous BMW and cant understand why it is not included on newer model.
Cannot use touch lock on door handles unless the remote is within 2-3 inches
When unoccupied the front passenger seat rattles
Engine light came on at 400 miles. Dealer replaced tank vent valve. Light came on again at 800 miles.  Dealer along with BMW engineer found a faulty NVLDS pressure sensor and replaced it. No further issues with this for past 3 months.
The seat belt holder is fixed . Therefore, the seat belt crossed directly over my neck.
Cup holder in the console is difficult for the driver and almost impossible for the passenger to reach.
This is my second X1 and both vehicles have had  noticeable wind noise.
: If the automatic locking door feature is on I have to manually unlock the doors with the control before I get out of the car to be able to go around and open the passenger doors or trunk to get things out of the car.
More noise than I am used to when accelerating from a stop.
The cup holders in the front doors don't hold bottles very well.  Everything seems to just fall over.  And the cup holders between the front driver and passenger seat are quite far to reach.  And they don't fit very tall or wide cups.
: unable to play music from my ipod, it is not recognized by my car as an external device . even when connected to the USB
The vehicle is not automatically recognizing the problem of excessive fogging on the windshield
the gauge indicates that I have traveled for about 50 miles whereas the GPS shows a distance of less than 30 miles consequently, the mileage on my car is reading much more than I am actually traveling
RADIO HAS POOR RECEPTION IN DIFFERENT AREAS
THE BUILD IN VOICE RECOGNITION NEVER RECOGNIZE MY COMMANDS
EXTREMELY HARD TO REACH THE SEAT BELT
From time to time, car pulls to the right.
: The rear wiper does not park to horizontal, it's always up a little bit.
It hits the brakes and/or turns off the system when I pass under highway signs, bridges, clouds , especially at night. As often as 3 times in 9 miles. After that the system is unusable again. It often refuses to turn on at all, especially when the sun is on the horizon.
: Computer often reports that the right cornering light is malfunctioning, even though it is working.
Major lag before the horn sounds, you have to hold it down a long time. A quick tap of the horn, like for ""excuse me, the light is green"" makes no sound at all.
Knob requires contortionist elbows to adjust while seated in the seat. Knob doesn't turn easily, take surprising force.
There are no rear heating/cooling controls, it's not even an option
There's a small ding in the passenger side aluminum panel above the glove box
The front rain sensing wipers seem to be erratic.  They change speeds frequently and are annoying.  Maybe just a matter of getting used them.
The door locks do not have a program option to unlock when the car in placed in PARK.  From the outside the door needs to be unlocked from the key or from the the inside.  I have other cars that can be programmed to unlock when I car is placed in PARK, and I prefer that.
Even when the A/C is set to blow air directly at the passengers, it doesn't deliver cold air until a long while later, if at all. I have to turn up the amount of air blowing all the way up to get cool in time for my 25 minutes commute to work.
Volume knob on dash is inconvenient for both driver and front passenger to operate--not within easy reach. The knob for changing stations or songs is not intuitive and complicated to operate. Low rate of success. Takes more training.
It's difficult to get it to work--takes concentrated effort
Not intuitive nor consistent with other German cars we've owned. Takes a lot of study to master.
Driver's seat control panel for adjustments has become unhinged and is hanging off. Rivets are broken/missing.
Apple Car play doesnt always connect and if you are making a voice text and a call comes in the system wont work again until you turn off the car and remove the phone several feet to reset
the time for the directional max is too low. Shuts  off before making a complete lane change.
: Screen is too light on the heads up. evn on the brightest setting
: Keyless entry configured to open all four doors . When starting to drive, the doors automatically lock . But when parked, only the front doors automatically unlock.
: Occasionally, when I unlock and enter the car, the seat automatically moves to a position other than what I've set.
Because it's located inside the console, when my phone is plugged in the cord is draped all around the gear shift. It's obnoxious and looks ugly. I wish there was a USB port behind the drink holders on the flat part where the phone rests.
The auto system is so loud that I NEVER use it. If I do accidentally turn it on, I can't have a conversation while it's on or listen to the radio. I guess it's working, but damn it's loud.
: Squeaking brakes.
I was told there would be some brake noise during a wearing in period
Manual mentions features not available.
Clock is a display item. Can't you make it any more complicated to show a clock somewhere on the dash?
Static on certain channels.
it is a small area of black discoloration of the silver piece on the console - near the gear shift
When engine is first started cold and not given sufficient warm up time  it can ""stumble"" or ""stutter"" a few seconds before settling in.
For a luxury vehicle the amount of road noise I would consider excessive, and at a level I have experienced with lower cost vehicles. : Road noise in the vehicle is more than would be expected of a luxury vehicle.  Windshield is less robust than other vehicles I have had in the past, and cracks and chips easily when hit by rocks thrown up by other cars.
The windshield glass is less impact resistive than my last vehicle.  Within the first 7 months of owning the car, I have two large star cracks from rock impacts.  The first happened while traveling less than 25 mph in traffic.  If this continues I will need to replace the windshield before the car hits one year. : Road noise in the vehicle is more than would be expected of a luxury vehicle.  Windshield is less robust than other vehicles I have had in the past, and cracks and chips easily when hit by rocks thrown up by other cars.
The vehicle response to rood deviations i.e. depressions or ruts in the pavement is at high speeds excessive compared to other cars I have driven in the past.
BMW assist did not function when car was delivered.  I had to return to dealership to have fixed.  Additionally the navigation system did not pull traffic data when delivered.
Voice recognition tends to not understand street names, cities, and numbers.  Have stopped trying to use voice recognition in regards to mapping.  It does a decent job changing the radio or making a phone call.
: Have to use the BMW app to send destinations to the car from my phone and google app.  Systems database of street names, address, and cities is lacking and does not come close to matching google maps and phone.  Navigation system would be better if google maps feed it data from the phone vs having its own database.: BMW assist did not function when car was delivered.  I had to return to dealership to have fixed.  Additionally the navigation system did not pull traffic data when delivered.
This winter it feels like the car pulls exterior air at a larger ratio than it should to maintain temp in the car.  Have to up the temp 3 degrees to get the temp to the level it was originally set, and stop the cool air from flowing.
Tailgate has opened three times due to keys being in pocket. There is no way to disable the automatic opening. I have a deep scratch on my tailgate due to it opening in my garage. There should be some way to disable the system but the manual does not indicate that there is one. I will be taking it to the dealer soon.
The Cruise control on my E90 was a superior interface. It was intuitive. This system requires me to look away from the roadway.
Leather is becoming discolored by the drivers clothes.
The symbols are hard to remember what they stand for.
Defrost is very loud and hard to hear surroundings over.
The heater gets too hot and when I try to turn it down it does not cool off quickly.
it will if I dial from my phone, but sometimes when people call me to goes to my phone directly and Not thru the vehicle , just noticed to today march 11, 2017
Once you find the tire pressure menu, the information is good. The problem though is that it's buried in the menus and not readily available.
The is no option to unlock all doors when the car is in park. I constantly have things in my backseat  that I need after I exit. When I park, I get out and of course the back door is still locked. I then have to either open the driver's door back up to unlock all doors or use the fob. I understand if this is the default setting but I should be able to program it the way I like. At this time, doing so is not possible.
Just feels like an outdated system.. almost like when Siri first came out. Disappointed in the technology and do not use it at all.
The system pairs fine but only allows for 2 simultaneous connects. I have 2 phones I use, my wife has 1. Anytime we're in the car, one of the devices won't connect and it's confusing. As far as the other issue, it's simply that Google Maps or Waze can't pair the audio correctly... I can't get turn by turn instructions because the system simply won't output the audio to the car.
: The right rear turn signal went out.
My shoe sometimes gets stuck underneath the break pedal.;
The center console is not easily accessible.
The cup holders in the back seat are not very functional.
On front passenger side the visor does not extend.
Left and right hatch doors get stuck on one another when opening from remote.
The navigation system is very complicated and difficult to learn. The written instructions are useless which doesn't help matters : The navigation system is extremely difficult to use and the written instructions are useless
: Hands free hatch door opener is not reliable
This problem is probably due to inability to distinguish foreign accents.
There is no way I have discovered to see the tire pressure state on the instrument panel. The best I can find is within the main menu which can't be safely accessed while driving.
tried Meijer Pharmacy multiple times to find # to call. Could not recognize and it is in my contacts list
The door to the fuel cap did not completely release and had to be manually pulled out with some difficulty
it almost never selects the correct name on my telephone contact list
The way it connects to my iphone for music and podcasts seems very random and I have to pick up the phone to make any adjustments
When accelerating from electric mode and the engine kicks in there is frequently a rough transition with a noticeable hesitation  I think this varies somewhat with the initial speed.
There are two modes of operation: a quick-turn mode where you touch the stalk briefly and it indicates two or three times then stops, and a continual turn mode. The first of these is no problem, though I would prefer it indicate at least 4 times because two or three times isn't enough. The second mode is a more 'permanent' turn indicator position, where is clicks into position  and stays there. Unless the steering wheel rotates at least 180 degrees back, the stalk will not snap back into 'neutral', and I can't get it to go back. usually, I will attempt to snap it back into a neutral position but must hit it so hard it goes past neutral to the other indicating direction. I know, picking nits, but this is the only car I've had this problem with.
One needs a Phd to figure out the wipers control settings, and even then they NEVER work properly and have a mind of their own.  This has been the situation on the last TWO BMWs I have owned.
: Three issues.  First the Low Tire Pressure Warning comes on almost EVERY TIME the outside temperature drops to freezing or below. BAD DESIGN FLAW! The second issue are the outside mirrors, they ALWAYS FILL WITH WATER after a car wash, then when you drive away the water slowly leaks out of the mirrors and RUNS down the sides of the car RUINING the fresh car wash EVERY TIME! This has again, happened on the last TWO BMWs I have owned!  A TERRIBLE DESIGN FLAW that needs fixing!  And last, the HORN sounds like a SHITTY AMERICAN CAR horn!  BMW has for some reason gotten rid of the classic BMW 'BEEP' trademark horn sound they have always had and have replaced it with the sound of a 1970's Plymouth!  SHAME ON BMW!!

The CD player ALWAYS skips the first few seconds of every song when it plays from the beginning of a CD!
: TWO issues. First there is a buckle of some sort in the backseat that just SITS in the rear seat  that has NO PLACE to be tucked in or out of the way for the passenger to sit comfortably!  I believe it is a buckle for a child seat.  This is unacceptable! The second issue is the head rests for the driver and passenger do NOT go all the way down, they still leave about a 1 inch gap!

: There are 2 issues. The first is that the DRIVER side and PASSENGER side control options are NOT the same, meaning the passenger side can NOT select the same air flow settings as the driver side. The second issue is that the cooling system in the backseat does NOT blow nearly as cold as the front, or as it should. Very poor design!

: This is a MAJOR issue with the last TWO BMWs I have owned and ALL other BMWs I have driven starting in 2014 with the exception of the i8. The issue is acceleration.  When I floor the accelerator pedal, there is about a TWO SECOND DELAY before the car will even move forward!  This is UNACCEPTABLE in a BMW and needs to be fixed!  Again...SHAME ON BMW!!!!
Drivers side wiper leaves a streak in the middle of the windshield.
It is located in a small dark space behind the cup holders. Hard to get plug in without scrunching down to see the outlet.
SLIGHT NOISE
Statements above describe accurately.
As stated : None other than poor size of speedometer gauge and lighting of same during daytime.
Only useful to store 'stuff' you don't need to access during trip. For instance, no where to store cell phones for thdriver and passenger, something everyone needs these days.
Cup holders directly in front of small storage area which also is in bad location and hard to use especially at same time a using cup holder. Cheap plastic handle also used to open this small storage area snapped off. Cheaply made.
sometimes calls dial and sometimes they don't
One of my primary concerns prior to purchasing this vehicle was the light color seats. I thought that they would scuff or soil easily for which I was assured that they wouldn't. I have only had the car for less than 3 months and the driver side seat is now a different color than the rest. It is due to the various colors of jeans that I wear.
Poor design of the glove box door and hinge. Items in the box keep falling out of the glove box when opened and into the door hinge area making it difficult to close.
It seemed hard at first to figure out how to adjust the navigation map.
It is hard to coordinate the controls with the lumbar adjustment
The seat belt latches, next to the seats, are hard to locate and both driver and passenger tend to hit the center console. So it is necessary to lift the center console to latch the belts.
Driver's seat, which is used more often, tends to soil easily, though the soiling, which is not definite but vague, comes off pretty well with a leather cleaner. It is a mystery as to why it occurs.
Seems like I need to push hard as compared to other vehicle I am driving
Voice recognition system is not effective.
Issue with blue tooth connectivity
Has only happened once so far on a very cold day.  Owner's manual states that this is normal at times.
system doesn't pick up commands often misinterprets them.  I have to manually enter commands.
its more of a nuisance the seat belts make a squeaking noise when in use.
while I appreciate the side bottle holders   the bottles often do not stay put and often shift while the car is moving causing noise.
there is a noise not sure if its a defect, the car runs beautifully- not concerned but will mention it at my next service visit.
Tervis tumbler, which was easily placed in my prior BMW cupholder, is awkward to place in my new car
E.g. i asked for POI - Boston Logan Airport - tried to bring up an address in Oregon
: rear hatch closed unexpectedly.  i had not engaged the close process
prefer traditional placement of parking brake
like heated steering wheel control on the wheel not the steering column
when lower fan speed sound dissipates
The dealer was notified of noise but we have not setup an appointment as yet
voice activation is often not recognized
Hard to program
Using the front wipers in a rain storm are just plain confusing. Difficult to get the speed correct for the amount of rain.
Under armrest makes it difficult to use.
Cant get addresses correct
Nav system as a whole is very difficult to understand and use. I just use my phone.
Part of my finger got pinched when grabbing the handle to open the door.
driving through a canyon at night with limited outdoor lighting. Wish headlights were a bit brighter to assist in navigating on a windy road.
headrest does not seem to be a perfect fit. The height is ok, but the shape of the headrest is not comfortable
The automatic release for the left passenger seat back located in the rear of the vehicle does not work any longer
It seems like they spray washer fluid when I just want them to wipe.
I want them to turn off automatically when I make a turn, but they don't.
Phone calls can sometimes have static when using apply CarPlay.
The Apply Play is difficult to set up and has required several attempts to get connected. It also has not always connected.
It seems my key is not working now to open it.
My key is not connecting
I don't like that the car has to be unlocked to open the gas thing.
It just doesn't work.
The Bluetooth interferes with multiple processes.  I cannot connect multiple things at once.  I am a Realtor and need wireless headphones, apple watch, and phone.  They interfere with one another.
The navigation using voice only works like 10 percent of the time.  Very frustrating.  The APPLE PLAY doesn't connect usually and interferes with apple watch and other devices.
I have apple car play option on my vehicle. I paired my phone the first day and it worked fine for the first month then it started working intermittently when I received a call while driving it would not instantly pair it would take 4 to 7 seconds. I stopped using it because it is frustrating when I'm trying to talk with clients and they can't hear me. I hope there is some update because right now Apple car play works half the time.waiting until first service at 10k miles to address
I find it difficult to operate the manual inside open close button to the hatch. It often will only open up halfway when I push the button and when my hands are full it is problematic. I am not sure what I am doing wrong so that it will open all the way when I manually open the hatchback and then push the button
The driver door sometimes  does not engage the latch when pulled hard enough to close based on its moving momentum. Not sure of cause, but I should not have to think about pulling 'harder' each time I get into the car. Having owned many cars over the years, including the first generation X5, this is the first time I have to remind myself to pull harder.
Approximately 3 months after delivery, I noticed that the steering wheel was no longer centered. Dealer stated that alignments are only warrantied up to 1500 miles, which at this time, the mileage on the vehicle was approximately 4900. This is a common engineering problem with newly installed/assembled, moving suspension components that require time to settle as the vehicle is driven. I feel that this should have been covered under warranty.
DON'T ALLOW ME TO TERMINATE GUIDANCE IN THE MIDDLE OF GOING TO THE DESTINATION : DON'T KNOW OF HAVE A FUNCTION TO STOP DESTINATION: WHEN YOU ENTER AN ADDRESS IN THE GPS AND YOU BEGIN TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS IT'S ALL GOOD BUT WHEN YOU SUDDENLY RELIAZE YOU KNOW HOW TO GET TO THE DESTINATION , THERE IS NO WAY TO STOP THE GPS FROM GOING TO THE DESTINATION.
Cell phone was connected but dropped off, not sure why
Seats pick up material color. Ex: we have tan seats and they pick up blue color from our blue jeans.
Have to press the break all the way until it stops : Have to press the breaks all the way
Navigation always has wrong information and not very accurate : Not very accurate
I don't like the glass quality. It stains easily and very hard to clean, especially under rain. I had a 5 series and I loved the glass on that car. But I'm not happy with my new x5 windshield glass : Poor quality glass
The truck hatch doesn't opens only slightly. I need to manually push the hatch up.
There was a blemish in the driver side door trim. I pointed it out to the dealership and they tried to buff out but then caused more damage by leaving swirl marks in both the driver door trim and the rear adjacent door.
The vehicle was transported from a FLORIDA dealership and I believe it may have been faceing backwards without adequate protection on the rear and it appears to have stone chips.
emission sensor problem - was repaired for free
drove me beyond medical building by a block and announced I had arrived
holds the manual, but that's about it.  Hard to get manual settled so that door can close.
Have been to the dealership three times with no success.  Quite frustrating.
Whether the center console or dash,  I have had the car in three times since I purchased it in November.
Small scratches/grooves with discoloration in molding on drivers side partially hidden when the drivers door is shut
No longer able to use Apple CarPlay for phone calls or texts. System does not switch between radio and those functions anymore.
It does not come out or reattach easily after removal.
One side of the Velcro attachment that inserts into the floorboard does not stay intact. Comes out all the time.
: Seat belt female end difficult to access
Cold airflow cannot hit face
they add beauty, but are very useless. too high to step on usefully, and annoyingly require a wide/far step when entering or exiting the car. for average height drivers,  leg/pants touch the boards every exit, on rainy days it gets you wet and dirty. very unlike BMW
I own to other cars with cooled seats . both are ford. , the seats there really cool. feels like AC in the seat. in this X6 its merely a light breeze.
The navigation system does not show you the next 'action item' so it makes it difficult to prepare for the next turn to take, etc.
: High beams have poor light
Breaks don't stop good enough when having to stop quickly from higher speeds.
No lights on the mirror make it useless at night and very hard to open the mirror.
The rear doors have to be slammed shut, and it's not immediately obvious that the door didn't close all the way when you're outside the vehicle. I'm not much of a ""door slammer,"" so when I open and close the rear door, I don't find out that it's not closed all the way until I start the car and subsequently get an alert about the ajar door in the display.
On occassion, the phone will not connect to bluetooth. i have calle and been to the dealer. i had not happened for a while until yesterday. mid route, it connected. the Genius at BMS indicated that sometime it is due to software updates.
I was told that this would be an issue so it was not a surprise yet its not the best thing to have happen
Screen display showed doors ajar after opening and closing.  Had to re-open and used more force to close, thereby alleviating the door ajar display on the screen.
Took me around a block and continued instruction to do same maneuver.
The auto door lock exterior feature often takes many tries to make it work.
The controls are just very touchy.
: Outside noise leaks through moon roof
If I did, I did not mean to say anything about turn signal.  It is the controls display that is not explained i the manual.
: Driver side exterior mirror glass is messed up.
Used it  when I went out to dinner; it's a good thing I knew where I was going because the navigation system was WAY, WAY wrong.
The manual is terrible in describing/explaining this system.
Manual does not do a good job describing how to use climate control system as a heater or what the differences are between AUTO mode or Manual mode (I know what AUTO means, I do not understand the differences between what each does.  The Manual is terrible, and not just about this.
Mileage terrible.  Not anywhere near what the sticker estimates.  The discrepancies between the gas guage, remaining range shown and miles driven after filling up are significant 
Heat shield came loose and caused sugnificant rattle.
Easily flat tire
Paint was scratched about 2-3' in length
Same comment as noted elsewhere - drivers seat apparently discolored from blue jeans : Seats discolored from blue jeans
The door design makes it hard to open and close
: The sun visor is too short and narrow, thus unable to fully block the sun particularly from the left
PLEASE NOTE 'WHEN DO ABNORMAL ENGINE NOISES OCCUR' there is no 'Other' option thus I put 'always' instead, please see below remarks: When engine turns to range extender mode, the engine makes a abnormally loud noise akin to that of a vacuum cleaner , the dealership at Mountain View said it is normal since it is a small engine!!!! : 1. Engine light icon comes on frequently, even after service, engine light icon comes on periodically 2. When switching to range extender mode, only once, there was a notification on the dashboard, thereafter, there was no notification at all 3. Loud engine noise overheard when in range extender mode: On the first conversion to range extender mode, the engine had an abnormal loud clanking noise, which i took it to the dealership for service.  After which, on the second conversion to the range extender, the noise turned to a noise similar to a loud vacuum cleaner noise
According to the Mountain View dealership, the engine light came on due to computer system from the charging unit. It was not mentioned by the service supervisor but on the receipt, it was suggested not to use EVGo fast charging station, as it will cause the engine light to come on. This is very frustrating indeed as the problem is recurring, not being able to use a fast charging station is not an option : 1. Engine light icon comes on frequently, even after service, engine light icon comes on periodically 2. When switching to range extender mode, only once, there was a notification on the dashboard, thereafter, there was no notification at all 3. Loud engine noise overheard when in range extender mode
i don't think that the rain sensor is not sharp enough.  it has a lot of water accumulating on the windshield but it won't clear quick enough, so sometimes i manually have to clean it up.
so small!!!
i suppose i just need to get use to it.
too many steps, too many options, it's good and bad
haven't had enough chance to give the feedback yet, but when i tried the voice guidance it didn't work well.
i tried several things then those functions eat up a lot of energy = miles, it once dropped 20 miles of range!  it wasn't a pleasant experience.
it's something to do with the caps & door of the charging.  i was told by the BMW seattle that i needed to open the door cap and put back in , then the engine light disappears.  very sensitive malfunction area.  if you don't know this trick, you have to keep bringing back the car to the dealer for a repair.  it's a hassle situation so after i charge the car, i put back the cap back twice to make sure this problem doesn't occur.  it's kind of redundant procedure but it seems to be working.  it's just the way it is.
The door latch location is too far from the seat. I am a petite person and my arms are not long enough to reach the latch easily.
Driver should be able to pull up seats higher to accommodate shorter people.
Difficult to understand how to adjust it.
the seats do not slide forward when folded. The seats should slide up to give better access to back seats.
when the sunroof is tilted open, it doesn't have a light or warning and the sliding cover can remain closed  so you don't notice.  Which is a problem if it rains.
The indicators seem quite slow - I am parked before the indicator says I am getting to close, and in reverse and moving before the indicator displays behind me.  It then stays on reverse indication for a second or two after I am already moving forward.
: the radio switches itself regularly to Pandora.  Randomly.  I don't use Pandora at all .
it is in the center console, which requires that I run the cable out of it and it then pinches the cable when closed. Would be nice to have a slot in the console.  Better if there was just a USB connection on the panel.
it isn't very intuitive, and I have been using BMW navigation for many years.  It isn't broken, but even after 'genius' guidance, I had difficulties with it and ended up using Waze off of my phone instead.
I have had BMW heated seats for many years, and this one seems to take a while to get warmed up - and doesn't seem to get as hot as others, but that is fine with me.
Apple play was a disaster.  It did not link up properly with my iPhone despite having the most up to date software on both the car and phone.  I disabled it completely without which my audio system wouldnt sync up properly with my apps including Pandora.  It is a useless feature, especially the maps.
Depending on the shoe, I must be careful to position my foot on the gas.  One may tap the brake if not careful.
The warning rarely comes on and when it does there is no sound, just a brief light. I try to make it come on and cannot. I don't understand what it is supposed to do. It only shows red but I think there is supposed to be an orange light as well.
The driver's seat is showing significant wear for a vehicle with 8000 miles on it, that was over $50,000!
Leather soils very easily and is not easily cleaned due to light color
I brought the car to the dealer where it was thoroughly checked out and deemed to be ok. It has not happened again.
Poorly designed
Poor Design
Icons aren't particularly intuitive
Very cheapy materials and will not last even in a warmer climate with no snow, ice, etc. I feel like BMW is forcing me to buy a replacement set a couple of times during my car lease term.
Getting in and out of the car one's feet scuff the lower doors, door sills. The floor mats are very cheapy and will not last.
: Check engine of for 3 days straight then on way to dealership it went out.  They were unable to determine the cause.
When the car is still cold the breaks make a noise while going in reverse. This noise does not happen when the car is warmed up
I think the center console is a bad spot for these ports.
Bluetooth disconnects frequently when on calls.
can not. change password on car's hotspot
Apple CarPlay just does not work well. Buggy, slow, sometimes doesn't work, and defaults to terrible Apple maps
Just getting bad gas mileage. Driving very conservatively for break in period.
Small scratch about an inch long on passenger rocker panel. Can be very slightly felt when rubbing finger over it.
Door unlock button is near top of center dash, which is a unique position from every other car I've driven. When in a rush I usually can't locate it.
It takes a fair bit of effort to move the lever into reverse. Some times are harder than others.
Very minor misalignment .  My be able to be fixed by a door adjustment.  Showed to a sales person when picking up plates will need to bring it back to service dept.
Sorry, It is minor not excessive
When it pairs with my iPhone it changes the media from what ever I am listing to Pandora which I never use.
I can only turn it on to the lowest setting for about 2 minutes then I need to turn it off or the seat will get too hot.
Under the armrest is good. Needs another, easier accessed USB port
The infotainment system, while good, is still too complicated and voice recognition is still poor. The Amazon Alexa system seems to have to best voice recognition today.
when playing music with Bluetooth will at times not recognize phone and have to control songs thru phone not car control device
hear a noise like car body at the doors are shifting when going bumps at slow speed
Door pull squeak when pulled closed
: Garage door opener doesn't work
It took me quite a bit of time to figure out how to use the wipers auto system. It's automatic but it took some time to activate the first time I used it and found it confusing.
The key fob has to be hit several times to get the trunk to release.
The driver information screen that sits in the middle of the dashboard is huge the navigation to all of the information is confusing and hard to understand, the voice control is the same control that I can get through my iPhone so I don't use it, and the radio controls are hard to understand. Plus there's a lot of information in the dashboard that I'm not really sure I need. I'd rather have had a GPS system there or a back up video camera. It's bad design.
It's just too complicated and it takes too many steps to get it to work.
The recliner adjustment is actually tucked underneath where the seatbelt comes out of the seat. You nearly have to get out of the car in order to see the location of the lever. It's a design problem.
The height adjustment is really hard to understand which way your movement of the lever is effecting the seat. If you over shoot where you want it, going backward is even harder to figure out. It's a design and engineering problem.
This size of an armrest in this small of a car is completely unnecessary and is constantly obstructing elbow room while driving when it's down. When the console is in the upright position the latch underneath gets caught on clothing and can scratch your arm. It's a design problem.
Center console blocks access to handbrake
Things always fall out when I open it.
The signal will just cut out at times.  At first i thought that it was whenever a police car or an ambulance went by, but that does not seem to be the case, although it does always happen then also.
Mpt easily cleanable.
I really like the MAX A/C feature for when you first get into a hot car, however, it seems i have to use that MAX a/c feature to keep bringing the temp up to the actual car temp because it doesn't maintain the car temp that i have set it on.
Discovered when polishing vehicle. Can be felt more than seen.
Backup mirrors rotate to close to the ground giving a cut-off view while backing up. Mirrors small and dark which make it hard to see at night.
Controls hard to find.
Heated seats get extremely hot even on lowest setting.
My son has hard time pairing his phone to listen to music
When pressing the fob button twice, both rear doors on the Clubman are supposed to open, and they do- I can hear the latch mechanism opening the door, but the door itself does not open. This is much more common with the inside door, the door that is opened second and closed first, the door with the latch to the car rather than to the other door. There are two doors on the back, the first one is latched to the second one and the second one is latched to the 'load lip' of the trunk or the trunk threshold. The second door, the one that latches to the threshold, does not always actually open when the key fob button is pressed, despite the fact that the latch disengages.
Electronic parking brakes are obnoxious in a car this small. It's not particularly easy to operate, it's slightly confusing to use- I just want a real parking brake like you get in the old MINIs.
When turning the turn signal off, the two-stage system means that it will start signaling right when all I wanted was for it to stop signaling left. Also, the three signals of the 'lane change' stage of the turn signal is not enough to make a normal, safe lane change.
The mirrors look good, but their round shape is awkward for normal driving- you don't feel you can see the whole lane and that does not inspire confidence on the road.
It will not skip songs on my Spotify playlist- I have to actually touch my phone and take my eyes off the road instead of pressing the skip button on the steering wheel or dashboard because the screen  reads 'Not possible'
The gray piece of plastic trim that circles from the driver to the passenger side, receding towards the windshield with the 'MINI' monochre at the center  reflects on the windshield and it provides an unpleasant line that constantly makes me worry I have scratched the windshield of a 3 month old car.
: When shifting it manually, the car likes to change gears by itself- there is a certain mode in which the instrument panel reads 'M3' for third gear rather than 'S3' and in that M designated mode, it shifts properly, but the controls are confusing and obnoxious to use so I usually just don't bother with it.
: Cargo cover snaps open while driving
Handle to release is covered by seatbelt when seatbelt has been latched
The trunk door too heavy and closes too hard. Needs a softer closing mechanism.
The night I drove off the lot I made a call via bluetooth. Once connection is established there is are loud static, crackling, popping noises through out phone calls.
Hard to work the handle under the seat and pull yourself forward or backward.
The lumbar support is controlled by a dial that is hard to turn especially since it is on the mid back side. It makes it awkward. Would be better if the seats controls were powered.
Too tight of a spot between the door and you need elbkw grease to pump the handle. Again, powered seats would be better.
Due to the small area between the driver and passenger, the seat belt receiver is to far down in between the 2 seats. The armrest is right over and in the way.
May not use enough to work out kinks. Still learning the system.
arm rest blocks access to handbrake
The system does not understand what I say, no matter how clearly and slowly I say it - it is frustrating
Probably my problem........still getting used to the system
doesn't matter how high i turn the temperature and how high the fan is turned up, my feet are always cold. seems there is no warm air positioned toward the floor
car seems to 'lurch' a bit when engine restarts -- like going on a small bump in the road
We've tried using it several times for directions but have not been successful. It doesn't understand what we have said. Have turned off the radio and stopped the car and still have problems with voice command.
: The connection to the music on my phone, either bluetooth or through the USB port is not intuitive and does not always deliver the same result. There are too many 'clicks' to get to the desired information screen.
: the radio, satellite and regular cuts out at signals. everytime you drive through a signal. Haven't talked to the dealer yet, I just figured it was due to having a mini antenna ....get it?
when using the phone you hear electronic popping
The lever is not in an easy place to locate. Wish I had electric driver seat.
It appears that the air conditioning reads 72, but it feels like it is humid and moist and 76 inside the car.
This is clearly a plastic piece. It feels like plastic and seems like it will be easy to break
Placed a cup in the holder and one prong is suddenly broken. Car is 3 mths old
I have had the car approx. 3 months and suddenly when the air is turned on it smells moldy.
I find the voice recognition for the phone doesn't connect me to the correct person I'm asking to call and a lot of times it takes several times before it finally gets the right person.
When opened fully or opened slightly, there is excessive noise from the sunroom. at speeds over 35 MPH. My previous car had a sunroom and I did not experience the same level of noise.
When shifting the manual transmission  pulls toward left.
As noted earlier, side mirror on passenger side seems to have poor curvature. Can't seem to get it 'just right.'
Horn location is fine and it is easy to operate, but honking sound is anemic
Poor response to voice commands. I've given up with voice commands and just go directly to my 'frequent call.'
There is a noise on that side of the car . Noises drive me nuts so I turn on the radio to cover the rattle/squeak.
I like having the console but it is awkwardly placed. Hard to reach. Also, it's in the way of the hand brake and I have to adjust the angle of the console to accommodate setting the hand brake and using the gear shift
Actually the problem has to do with the passenger side mirror, but there is not a check-off for that. Specifically, the curvature of the passenger side mirror appears to be more distorted than usual. Not able to adjust to get to that side mirror just right.
See previous answer : I have driven a manual transmission for 50 years. The MINI gears do not shift smoothly- which is disappointing since I understood that BMW 'German engineering' was now a part of MINI engineering. Shifting to reverse takes the strength of Hercules; and the gears get 'hung up' way too frequently when starting out from a standing position  It's not unusual that gears might get 'hung up' once a year or so on a rare occasion, but this is frequent. Previous to purchasing the MINI I drove for over 13 years a 2003 VW Jetta. The manual shifting mechanism was very smooth and seamless. With the MINI, not so much.
It is difficult to open, I must be in park and use 2 hands.
Voice recognition for navigation doesn't work well, misinterprets street names. too many steps, have to input state.
easier to use navigation system on iphone. by the time system understands the address, i could be there, takes too long to get the address in there by toggling, as voice recognition is not good.
The foot wave option does not work all the time...we tend to use the key fob instead....
The inside of the wheels are all rusted...we were told this is common and cannot be repaired
The latch holding the rear cover in the hatch part of the vehicle is broken
: The front windshield does not clean well at all after using the wipers. There are always spots that remain from insects and flies that come in contact while driving.  I had taken the vehicle to the dealership within 2 weeks of purchase and they told me I have to clean it manually from time to time. That to me was totally ridiculous. I have never had this problem in any of my previous cars .
Most of the times, it shows the route which is longer distance wise and well as time wise.
small compartment to the left of steering wheel. Cheaply made and doesn't line up with edge
Sometimes it seems that the system does not recognize words or misinterprets
I must manually and deliberately re-pair my cell phone to the vehicle every time upon entry.
The rear bumper access door fell off had to order a new one.
Sounds like the wheel is rubbing in the liner or something but could not make it happen when I took to the dealer.
: The bluetooth dropped b y phone pairing only once. I had to remove and re pair.
Sounds like a vibration a low hum but cannot make it happen.
I have a hard time connecting the seatbelt  It is easier if the console is lifted. I have small hands, but someone with larger hands would definitely have to lift the console to fasten the seatbelt...........not enough room.
: the back hatch will close without using any buttons
the squeak comes and goes while seated in the seat, it is in the rear left side of the driver seat.
It hesitates a little, then lurches
: Steering wheel block the view of the temperature time and milage to to poor design placement of this data on the dashboard.  I have to lean forward in my seat if I want ti see this information
I am 6'6"" tall,  Though I am only 180 pounds the contour seat are to tight on my hip bones and legs and VERY uncomfortable.  I have tried placing a pad on the seat but that seems to make may back suddenly be pushed forward by the contour of the top of the seat back.  Make the seat more comfortable.  I have been searching for a way to make the seat more comfortable but so far to no avail.
it is too hard to put large size cups into the holder
No adjustments in rear
One of the back exterior lights is not housed properly. It is protruding out from one side.
Sometimes in intersections, it is not easy to orient yourself since the map does not automatically zoom in.
There was just a scratch in the black trim.  My car came from a different location.  My dealer fixed it immediately.
I think this is just characteristic of this model.  The X1 had more road noise than the sedans.
Locking and unlocking require using your hand and fingers in a different manner.  I was not given proper instruction and did not know they were different so I thought the system was not working.
: The keyless entry was the only issue.  I do not like the shape of the center rearview mirror.  It limits field of vision.  I also liked the shape of the old side rear view mirrors.  The shape on my 2003 allowed me to see a larger area.
: I kind of feel the Speaker volume is a 2 or 3 notches low even though this BMW has got 7 speakers. Other car speakers produce a good sound volume even with 4 or 5 speakers.
After having got used to google Maps on the 4G Smartphones, the BMW Navigation system is little step in the past. The product owners at BMW should either make the experience equal to google Maps or excel it.
: unless i have the the heater/fan going, the windshield fogs up.
intermittent annoying vibration/buzzing noise mainly on interior passenger side while driving 25-40 mph.  Going over rough bumpy roads increases the vibration noise.
intermittent annoying vibration/buzzing noise like I've mentioned two times previously.
intermittent annoying vibration/buzzing noise that seems to be primarily on the passenger side and also seems to be temperature related; colder has more noises than warmer climates. I have told the dealer about the problem and was told to bring it in but haven't found a convenient time to do so yet.
same as before
hard to understand
the system seesm to have a mind of its own and operates when it wants even if not wanted
too far from driver
ETA is always wrong
Very Low Profile wheels/tires on M-sport package with runflat tires cause this
Hard to raise/lower
The car is so refined everywhere else but the visor is difficult to unclasp and move to side,
Sited from the drivers seat when looking thru the passenger midrange front window
: The air -condition always turn on when I start the engine.In fact,I don't know if it is a problem.
In AUTO A/C is slow to cool cabin.
its annoying.  Always vibrates when you are on curvy roads
The temperature doesnt seem accurate.  That could also be user error.
Temperature doesn't seem accurate
They squeak, what more is there to say.
The bluetooth in the car continues to think there is a call underway even though the phone call has disconnnected. This prevents me from making another call or using Bluetooth at all. I have to turn bluetooth off on the phone to get it to work again. 
have had a hard time figuring out all the elements of the seat.  i haven't had my ""training"" yet on the vehicle so it is just hard to figure out on my own.
one of rear mats does not fit correctly.  seems smaller than the other rear floor mat.
I dislike the fact that I basically have to SLAM the hood down in order for it to latch. I have not experienced this problem with any other car brands . I don't know if this is a defect or if it's just the way BMW's hood latch works. It's not a major complaint but it's definitely a concern. I was always taught not to slam the trunk or the hood of a car.
The sub-woofer under the front driver seat was defective according to the dealer.  Within a few months it suddenly began making a flapping or vibrating noise and produced inconsistent bass.  Since replacement I haven't had any issues.
The seat belt was locked in its starting position next to the door.
Oversteer
Poor design. Clutch and break are way too close together. Sometimes I accidentally hit the brake and the clutch at the same time. I believe the main issue is that the brake arm goes over the clutch
: Car shut off at 600 miles and would not start up again. It had to be towed into the service center. A week later and one component change later, I received the car back. Three days later the car shut off again and refused to turn on for an hour. Back to service again. It took them two weeks, working with the factory in Germany and Corporate to find the issues. Both fuel pumps an another electronic component had to be replaced. This was at 700 miles. The car was not even broken in. Since then the problem has not reoccurred but I am very disappointed. The engine still shakes violently when turning off and I'm constantly afraid it will once again shut off on me.

When I am in neutral and try to put the transmission in first gear. it sometimes gets stuck. I'm forced to put it into second gear and then go into first gear in order to be able to drive.
The mats that came with my car were so cheap that I was embarrassed to show my sister who had just gotten a new Mercedes and had nice emblem on her floor mats.
Foot motion sensor rarely works
The triangle at base of mirror is hard to see. You look at mirror first and triangle is too small and not in field of vision.
I have no idea what this is trying to tell me. There is no audible signal.
there are 2 small digital readouts for time - not easy for passengers to find if they don't know where they are.  the ""screensaver""  goes to a big image of an analog clock after about 30 seconds - why can't i get that image on demand?  That is, as part of the split screen, or just because I want to see the clock - it's cool!  Also, I have wifi and I have taken trips between different time zones.  The automatic time zone doesn't work at all - I manually switch from CST to EST when I drive from Illinois to Ohio.
This system is FAR better than my 2012 BMW and any other vehicle I've had, but it should come with some kind of manual to ""teach"" me the logic of the system.  That is, it's constantly confused between looking up a car wash on the internet when i often want it to search my saved contacts and use that address.  Why can't I tell it to search the contacts?  When I want to drive ""home"" it often asks me which of 3 ""home"" addresses it wants.  One is called ""policy home"" - shouldn't it just be clear I want the already-defined home address?  Again, it's good - but i need the tricks to be able to understand what the system wants.  The manual is not well defined.
it is difficult to use the USB port from inside the console. i need at least one other outlet
Argh, where do I begin. The whole system is like playing a video game with ""3D"" graphical representation of things. For example, instead of a simple easy to read elapsed or remaining time indicator for a CD track, there is a thin glowing bar that creeps across the bottom of the screen. There is no display of full info for a track at the same time . The SiriusXM tuner only shows channel name when browsing, rather than currently playing artist/song . The SXM display does not scroll long song titles, they get cut off instead. The SXM ""favorites"" feature will switch from ""Presets"" mode to ""SXM"" mode if you play a ""favorite"" when the notice pops up. And live the Nav system, no printed manual is included so I must search online for answers to any questions.
The only thing I've tried using voice recognition for is Navigation, and it works so poorly that I've stopped trying.
Some addresses that do exist are not found by the Nav system. There does not appear to be any way to save an arbitrary address, i.e. there is no ""address book"" feature. There is no printed manual provided, so finding features and instructions is difficult; I resort to searching various BMW online forums.
Actual addresses are not found . Routes are often ""nonsensical"", e.g. going way out of the way to take freeways instead of the streets. In terms of route quality, especially considering traffic data, it just can't complete with Google Maps.
There are so many ways to set and reset and override the memory settings, with multiple drivers, multiple keys, multiple buttons. I do not profess to have the solution, but some engineer needs to figure out a way to make this simple for everyday drivers who don't want their seat settings messed up by themselves accidentally, or by a valet, or whomever.
There are separate left/right temperature settings, but there does not appear to be a way to sync them. The ""auto"" function does not appear to control fan speed at all.
The problem is the ""auto"" mode does not control fan speed, so unless I manually turn up the speed it takes too long to cool down, or if I leave the speed up too high it gets too cold. Automatically controlling only the temperature of the air is insufficient to be an ""automatic"" system.

With the radio off I hear some kind of rattle/tick coming from the top/left/front part of the dash near the A pillar. It's pretty consistent on less smooth roads below 50mph or so.
The engine shuts down the instant the car comes to a complete stop, whereas I would prefer a setting to delay the shutdown by some number of seconds after stopping. Consider a series of stop signs each one block apart . If you come to a complete  stop, the auto stop/start feature introduces an annoying disruption and delay where the engine shuts down and immediately restarts. If the system could wait two seconds before shut down, this ""series of stop signs"" problem would be avoided, while still allowing the car to shut down at a red light. The alternative is to perform an  rolling stop at each stop sign, or to disable the system altogether.
: Universal garage door opener difficult to program.
Seat belts are hard to buckle with booster
Too close to the console  so large cups don't fit well.  Only two holders in front and they are in front of charger slot so you have to sacrifice one or the other.
does not work with my Samsung Galaxy 6, have tried using other apps, but this causes propbelms with applications on my phone
When cable is connected, arm rest will pinch and damage cable if phone is not inside the armrest compartment. This USB port also does not appear to charge the phone so went to the other cigarette plugs
random and infrequent squeak, have not determined any pattern as yet
Sometimes do not find that my phone is explicitly paired per the screen. Also when trying to use radio, I note that the speaker is connected to the telephone and there is no way of disconnecting. Thus I need to make another call and then disconnect before being able to connect to the radio
The brakes have a loud squeaking noise during the first couple of minutes right after it rains or snows and the brakes get wet.
I prefer the tight steering of the older model bmw's.  I find the lighter/looser steering on these newer bmw's harder to negotiate at higher speeds.  Find myself over steering alot.
: Not enough usb outlets.  Volume is very low when using navigation through mobile phone via bluetooth. ]
Doesn't fit under gas pedal : The floor mats dont fit under the gas pedal
The BMW cannot handle bumps on the road very well, and offroad driving - no thank you.
: As noted. Also the radio reception is not so good. Stations 45 min down the road after come in and out a lot.
The entertainment navigation system really needs to be a touch screen. IT is annoying using the current system as it takes forever - I just use my iPhone so I feel I wasted my money with this system .
Cannot get audio through car audio system for Spotify app
Coffee travel mug fits in holder, but interferes with operation of dashboard instrument panel. Perhaps move cupholders closer to storage area in center console.
Car appeared to have a problem with the alignment, would pull to the right. Had alignment checked, everything was correct. Dealer swapped front left and right tire, car then pulled to the left. Unsure of what is wrong with the tires and I am still working with dealer to identify the exact issue and find a solution.
There was a leaking vacuum hose and also tire pressure monitors were not installed so we kept getting tire pressure warinings
check engine light came on within 2 days of buying the car. we were told it was a leaking vacuum hose
I have to tilt the armrest back to comfortably reach the parking break.
My left foot always come in contact with the break pedal any time I am taking it off or putting it on the clutch pedal
A small piece of the black molding along the top of the car appears to be torn.
Driving on rural roads, the road noise can be very loud.  This is when I have problems with voice recognition.
Blue jeans wear off on the white seats.
The air vent to the right of the steering wheel blows into the steering wheel instead of the driver.
The seat is too hard
It is hard to set the wipers to the speed of the rain. It seems to just be really slow or really fast, the sensors don't seem to work for the rainfall. It is unclear how to do it manually. I usually make the back wiper go instead of the front, to usability is unclear.
personal fault, extremely minor
This car was driven to Miami by the owners of the dealership--I didn't notice the wheel at time of delivery
The right front bumper area where the tow hook is --Fell off twice--now I havethe third one glued on--I did not pay for the replacements although was told people are stealing the cover???  Since I haven't seen another white clubman since I purchased this one.
see above
Very temperamental  and very hard to get to reset when there is really no problem
The control has to be in driver side mode to have the backup mirror return to normal drive position.
Hard to use, especially if you want to use the drink holder also.  Cords are in the way--no place to rest your phone so ends up on floor or wherever. cigarette lighter is in the way also.
When call is made the system keeps trying to redial after the conversation has ended.  Difficult to move on to another contact etc.
Try anything and everything--I live in Florida so temperature varies.
Had a flood--the air conditioner  drain was not connected so all the moisture/water poured directly into my car.  The carpets were removed and dried out--however the driver seat was removed and when I picked it up it was not bolted down to the floor.  I drove it about 150 miles before I realized it was free and once again --back to the dealer : see above--air conditioner drain/driver seat problems   Now I do have mold around the gas pedal which I clean out almost weekly  I am just really tired having to bring the car back and either wait or whatever.
I purchase large Ice Coffee--cupholder is difficult to hold it and makes the control panel unusable
: Fuel door/cap looks and feels really cheap and loose. Poor quality.
It comes from the rear passenger side. I cannot pinpoint what it is.
Very easy to gather dust and other dirt. Also doors scuff very easily just by getting in and out with shoe marks, etc..
Cavity wax is still coming out of the edges of the hood corners nearest the front bumper, through both the grill and above the wheel wells. I've already spoken to MINI USA and my dealership about the cavity wax and they both told me there's nothing I can do other than let it come out... I get it, and I'm in Florida so it may be more fluid than usual, but it has already stained the black plastic molding around wheel wells. The dealer told me they will do a free one-time replacement, but to ""wait until the wax stops dripping out before doing the repair because it can only be done once."" I prefer my new car always looking new and am unhappy I am being told to wait, with ugly white line stains on my car.
: Navigation system sporadically acts strange, or ""buggy"", when switching between Apple CarPlay and BMW iDrive navigation.
Phone is hard to access when placed in wireless charging dock.
All weather mats soil very, very easily.
Particularly when it snows the front collision warning goes off everytime I slow down even when no one in front of me. I have driven miles with the annoying beeping in a snow storm because I guess the sensor doesn't work in snow:-(
: The bluetooth is terrible. It takes a while to connect and when I start the car it seems random at what it plays on my phone - sometimes an audio book plays other times music regardless of what I played last. If I plug my phone in music starts even if I have it off, the whole thing just feels very buggy and poorly done.
My wife calls it a ""new"" car smell and almost can't be in my car because of it
Hard to understand how to get air out of different vents.  When it is really hot and you want to cool the car off quickly it is hard to know how to cool quickly
The BMW system and Apple interface is difficult to use, especially during driving times.
Switching between I-Phone and BMW system is difficult and I-Phone seems to automatically take-over the system. Trouble w/ the BMW contacts system.
Brakes make noise when stopping in reverse.  Took the car in & was told this can happen while car is still in the break in period and should get better by itself.
i find the gas and brake pedal is close
Brake dust accumulates frequently and requires cleaning at least 3 times weekly
Apple Car Play can have issues of connectivity and difficulty switching between ""native"" BMW controls and Apple Car Play
Difficult to wash completely way
I have to use excessive force to fully prevent rolling with handbrake on
I have no idea how to control the speed of the wipers.  Dealer never went over it and it is so not intuitive. Still don't know how to use the automatic sensor for wipers
Wire gets smashed in center console
Controls are close to other seat adjustment controls and it's hard to tell which switch does what
Doesn't seem to make a noticeable difference.
Too easy to adjust headrest forward, often do it accidentally, then too difficult to move it back
Dealer never explained how to set it
: Back seat row doesn't get cold enough with AC blasting
Electric motor wouldn't turn on at all
The brakes squeak at the very end of the stop. I was told by BMW that it is normal for M brakes to squeak towards the end of the stop because they are high performance brakes. I still find it annoying.
Display is hard to see when wearing sun glasses. I live in southern California and sun glasses are necessary always. With no glasses on the display is perfect.
the PRND is counter intuitive and will cause minor problems with persons that operate other cars
there in a small storage door at the rear of the center console facing the rear passenger seat that will not stay closed.
I wear black soled shoes. the scuffing occurs at the release handle for the hood  and at the lower door panel
Engine light on - needed replacement part, part replaced  - light still on.  Need additional service to fix it.
Noticed a rattle while driving on the passenger front seat
The button to release the rear hatch is in a hard to reach position.  Also when you exit the car the doors do not unlock so the rear latch does not work until you manually unlock the doors.
You can't program the doors to unlock when the car is turned off.
The seat fabric doesn not breathe, the seats are incredibly warm to sit on.
I seem to need to raise the speakers to a much louder level than necessary
Wires run across transmission shift. Closing console often ruins wores
: Rear seats not recline easily
The automatic sensor doesn't seem to ""sense"" the rain well. At times of little rain the wipers will go much faster than necessary and then there are times when I have significant moisture/rain on the windshield and they don't operate frequently enough.
It is difficult to find the correct spot to push to sound the horn and it requires more pressure than I would expect.
Reception fades in and out frequently if set to HD.
The heat doesn't warm up very quickly and there is very little heat coming from the vents near the foot area.
The glove box is small and when opened the contents fall out easily due to the angle of the opening.
The cup holders are in a location that is not easy to reach and the angle to pull out bottles, etc. is awkward.
Didn't know there was a latch to open the hood.
I've never been able to open the hatch manually.  Always have to use the key fob or latch inside the door.
Would like to access this information from steering wheel controls lik I did on my Acura.  This car is sorely lacking in controls and placement of controls in comparison to Acura.
When I select the eco fuel option I can't see the odometer.  It doesn't display during eco fuel.
Controls for navigation need to be at eye level and not a knob on the console where one has to look down to find the knob.  Takes focus away from the road.
It is above the front cup holders so you can plug in and recharge your I-phone/I-pad/Kindle or you can have your coffee mug.  The location is inconvenient because regardless of how you use the power plug, it takes away at least one of the coffee holders.
I have a Starbucks insulated 'grand' size thermos.  It bumps against the dashboard sometimes when I put it in the cup holder and when I take it out.  It's not insurmountable.
scanned the car at dealer didnt notice it was night and very minor came straight home parked in garage went out next morning bacause i love my cars was waxing it and noticed it.
lose satellite reception in parking ramps.  also have poor FM reception.
Not sure if this is a real problem. It just seems to take longer to stop the car than I am used to.
It does not seem out of the ordinary for this car. Loose compared to my other cars.
They are awkward because they must be opened very wide so that they dont crash back onto your  legs and to do that you have to lean out far while pushing the door and by that time you are practically f falling out onto the road. Honestly its a little dangerous
They are awkward to open when you are inside the vehicle because they need to be opened so wide so they dont  crash back into your legs that you have to lean out and push and by that time you are practically  faling out the door.
The car averages 14.7 mpg in city driving. While i understand that city driving is not as fuel efficient as highway driving, I think with the technology of today fuel  efficiency should be better even for city driving.
Not obvious to use, spent a long time trying to work out how to open the hood
It mainly happens when my husband is using it. May be his voice tone.
Not large enough
Hard to figure which way it goes. Not clear.
Was transporting a piece of wood and it touched the door slightly and created a small tear very easily.
broken - doesn't open. opens frm outside
door doesn't open from inside
seats and wheel - if even a touch of sunscreen or cream gets on them and you don't take care of it immediately, it stains
mini  connect is complicated, hard to reach and hazardous  because it forces you to take your eyes off the road in order to page through its many screens, which are located in the center of the dashboard
Tailgate automatic open is not working consistently.
wind noise not extreme, but more than I think should happen with a high end car like this.
To operate parking brake, must have in ""Park"", foot on brake, ignition in accessory mode or engine running.... seems way too complicated
Some information displayed is too small, cluttered, seems hard to find information needed to operate.  Information not organized in logical or intuitive way.
Navigational system is not very intuitive to operate.... still in learning mode
Like many things on this car, controls are different from other cars I've had and generally not intuitive, at least to me.
Supposed to get an average of 21 mph; actually get more like 18 mpg with mixed highway/city driving
hard to find amongst menu items, no easy, quick check process
Crack originating from the top of windshield
The cruise control and the radio controls are on opposite sides from other minis I have owned. It makes me nervous that I could increase speed instead of volume.
Although I clearly state the name or number it plays back the wrong name or number. This even happened when I picked up the car from the dealer and the sales person was going over systems with me.
air conditioning comes on sometimes when I start the cat and it wasn't selected to do so.
hard to insert most cups into holder. must be very careful not to spill drinks. Holders have too much friction trying to hold the cup.
It's loudest with the convertible top down and in auto mode.  When auto is turned off the fan is quieter.  This may be by design, but something the dealer should point out.
The seats are light  and they get dark marks on them from wearing jeans.  Comes off easy enough with Mr. Clean's Magic Eraser
I have to press the remote key to open trunk although I'm carrying my sensored key in my purse/pocket. It should read off me without having to hassle getting my keys from my purse and have to press the button!
My car got snowed in and when the snow melted, it went inside the side panel and I can hear a splash every time my car came to a complete stop!
I can hear my breaks every morning when going to work going downhill
Living in California, the temperature doesn't get ""too"" hot and even then, the car takes at least 5 minutes to cool inside! Which I would have driven a few miles by then!
I also use the water hose to get rid of the fog.
After my 3rd BMW purchase, all rear cup holders were broken and would not close!.... Very sensitive, if you have ONE person of at least 100lbs sit over it, it will break and it will never close again!
: When phone is paired via bluetooth , entertainment switches automatically to last used media e.g pandora even if there is no intention to use the same  and it takes too many steps to switch back
Occasionally the Apple Car Play system will completely disconnect.
I got recall letter that BMW AG has decided that a defect, which relates to motor vehicle safety, exists in my model BMW i 3. One or more air bags may not have been produced to specifications.
: Ambient lighting on door panels is distracting while driving at night. They can not be turned off, only dimmed. And when you shut the car off and turn it back on, the lighting is back up to full brightness making it necessary to go through four levels of menus to get to the dimming control feature. When I bring it to the dealers attention, I am going to have them disconnect this 'feature'
You tell it where you want to go, It routes you the most round-about, high traffic, out-of-the-way route. I'm back to using my smart phone for navigation.
Set the seat adjustment for each driver. When the new driver operates the vehicle, they have to manually readjust their seat/mirrors.
Difficult to store the removable rear cover when not at home. If I need to remove the cover to make room for large cargo it is difficult to store it anywhere in the car.
The right rear compartment door will open spontaneously if the car is not locked, parked with the engine off, and the key fob is not inside the car.
: The satellite connection is lost more than in my husband's 2017 Mercedes Benz GLC 300.
Needs easy explanation and function of them. : Because of the position of the steering wheel, I cannot see the speed of the car sometimes although I do not drive fast.
I do not how to adjust lumbar support.
I just leave it long and floppy
Makes noises while driving
Seat wings are uncomfortable
When I try to enter an address the navigation system sometimes fails to find the Point of Interest.
slight distortion in the windshield on passenger side.  It is not enough to warrant a replacement, in my opinion. Just more of a minor annoyance.
finger prints, soiled marks
No audible indicator of car in blind spot, only steering wheel vibration which is sometimes difficult to detect.
Will often take routes that are completely out of the way. At one time added 50 miles to my trip before I realized.
It's a buzzing noise from center console at 60+ MPH.
I had to bring my car into service @ 1200 miles and told them that the noise was unbearable.  People would stare at me when i was driving by.  There was foreign material inside the breaks that had to be removed.  the break plates also had to be replaced
there was a wet shammy left in the trunk of the car that i didnt notice when i first took it home.  it left a mildewy smell that's still there now.
Seems to be possibly related to the seat belt mechanism and occurs when the seat is in certain adjustments, not all of the time.
apple car play frequently doesnt sync w phone so phone calls arent transferred to car speaker/ mic system
Controls are completely unintuitive and once a setting is set I am not able to change it anymore.
When you manually open it it should start engaging the servo to open the door.
It shuts down immediately when the vehicle slows down in stop and go traffic. There should a delay to ensure that one really is at a traffic light.
Not a malfunction... just mediocre design of the controls for the nav system. I end up using WAZE on my phone, instead, as it's infinitely easier to use...
difficult to find the simple 'intermittent wiper' position.
hidden on side of driving column
the cup holder does not hold a large insulated mug. The mug hits the bottom of the instrument panel, it's not a high enough space for the cup to fit in without scratching the panel.
The gear indicator and time indicator are behind the steering wheel and not visible unless you crane your head around to find a spot where they can be seen.
Lumbar adjustment does not seem to make any difference.
Head rest hits the back of my husbands head and pushes it forward into an uncomfortable position. : Headrest is uncomfortable.  Also I have received a recall on the passenger side air bag about 1 month after I bought car.  I am very surprised that this was not fixed before car was sold.  I had to take to dealer to find out exactly what the recall was for , and I have to take back again to have repaired when parts are available.  I'm disappointed I have to put all this time into a brand new car.
Hard for me to get my hand in correct place to release. Also I am short and the seat belt portion that crosses the front of me goes across my face. This is very, very uncomfortable. I have purchase after market clip for the belt to keep it off my face. The manual says I can adjust the seat belt but I do not see any place where I can adjust.
When driving, it is difficult to reach around gear shift to put container into/ or take out of cup holder.
You have to hold the key fob down really long in order for the trunk to fully open.  If it is a quick press, the door will open just a couple of feet.
The height of the headrest does not fit someone of short stature.
Seat belt cuts into my neck area.
The angle means you have to tilt the container pulling it out causing spills.
The back door cannot unlock automatically
Hard to use the feature. Don't feel it's comfortable and reliable
inaccurate and not reliable to use.
It's stuck
Door wouldn't open with fob and only open when my hand was in a specific position on the handle.
The back would only open a small amount and wouldn't pop open all the way. Resolved itself.
Wouldn't light when opened. Was replaced by dealer.
The location is too far back to easily insert/remove the jack. Perhaps a taller person, who kept the driver seat further back, wouldn't have this problem, but I'm of average height .  I ended leaving a cable in the jack at all times, which probably isn't good for the jack over the long term.  A front facing USB port in addition to the 'hidden' port would be nice.  There is a cigarette lighter type port that is front facing, but it requires an adapter and takes up too much valuable real estate in that section due to the proximity of the drink holders.
The pronunciation is sometimes difficult to understand, and at times the instruction is not given far enough in advance to prepare.  It's not terrible, it just could be better.  It could be my learning curve, but I've also had difficulty trying to get back to the Address entry from say Zip Code entry.  I usually end up starting over from the top.  Selections of letters/numbers using the 'dial' is good, I have no issues there.
Small paint chip on rear bumper
: ""Increased battery discharge"" warning appears if car hasn't been driven for a couple of days
Small scratch on the hood that was repaired by the dealer.  Please see my prior survey for details.
On one occasion, the door would not latch shut because the mechanism clasp did not roll, allowing door closure.  Please see my prior survey for details.
The driver side clock would be better positioned at the top of the gauge panel
Its not a problem but there is a small plastic cap missing from a section next to the drivers door near the footwell. I noticed it a couple of months ago and the dealer ordered it from Germany but I still havent rec'd the cover
The gas pedal is too elevated  causing your foot to rest in an uncomfortable position.
Shaft came out of transmission.
I mostly feel it in the confort mode. I switch to eco pro mode to avoid it.
Can't describe it fully except that it does it upon acceleration. Thought it just naturally made the noise.
Just difficult to know which operates which portion of wiper blades
Wish it were user friendly
Took two weeks to find out I had heated option
Not easy to navigate
Cup holders too small
Often says can't connect. Seems to be more of an issue with apple car play. Also, when connected, there are times when there is a call in progress, car play recognizes, doesn't turn radio off and phone says volume is through car. Can't hear caller until it is switched back to iPhone volume.
Owners manual has to be held up in order for door to close. Manual should be made to fit space or shape of box should be different.
Chips bottom of plugin outlet
Buckle seated too low.
: Does not detect cars in blind spot all the time.  Will be taken this to the dealer
Dealer said that when heat is on to defrost AC button will light up green, ,and thats normal.
: Warm air comes out of the vents as a default instead of no air or the last setting used in the car. Even if the temperature is set at a cooler temperature, warm air is emitted. t seems I need to press the Air Conditioning button and adjust for each outing, which stops the warm air.
It makes a faint whistling noise at higher speeds
Truck just does not seem to ride smooth.....feels vibration.
Neutral is difficult to shift into.
There was a chip we noticed on the hood about 5 minutes after delivery. The scratch on the back was found a week or so later.
BMW iDrive system conflicts with Apple Carplay
BMW iDrive conflicts with Apple CarPlay
Roof was damaged in transport. 4' long, 0.5' deep dent near sunroof
clean air vehicle/access ok stickers from California were not removed
: Air sound from driver's door when driving on the highway, its mild but would expect better from BMW
hard to ""tap"" the horn, not loud enough
doest retract entirely to the door when i un buckle, this leads to the door not closing sometimes
There have been a few times door does not close initially.  I have had to slam the driver's door a few times in order for the door to close.
Method of opening and closing is annoying. You have to open the front doors to then open the rear.
Anytime you switch to MMC or Multimedia Audio the volume is at the cereal and you must increase the volume. This is ridiculous! Additionally, if you do not fasten your seatbelt the gone slash PDC will keep going off and adjust the volume only serves to adjust the volume of the gone and not the entertainment source get right BMW!!
My HTC 10 mobile phone connect consistently with audio for the entertainment system however, the phone will not pair anymore VA the audio for the telephone I must restart my phone and then it will pair! Again $56,000 unacceptable!
Next turn indication is very slow to respond and often I'm waiting for the screen to come on and tell me my next turn! However the next turn comes up short distances between the time allowed to make that and over. Additionally, well my biggest gripes with this car is the clock is non-existent or must have certain screens available to it the clock to be displayed period for a $56,000 car just unacceptable! Just one of the shortcomings of this vehicle.
It's difficult to lower the seat for two reasons. 1) The lever to adjust height is next to the lever to adjust the seat tilt and it's easy to get the two confused. 2) The height adjustment mechanism seems to be spring-operated and I do not weigh enough to force the seat lower. I have to get my heavier husband to make this adjustment for me, which is very inconvenient.
range extender did not engage when battery had no power. Car lost power on a major highway amid rush hour traffic. Had to pull over into the breakdown lane, completely shut off car and restart it. Range extender then engaged but not to full power. Brought vehicle in for service. Dealer very responsive but problem could not be duplicated. No further problems.
Brake power seems to fade in or out/ they are a bit mushy and inconsistent. Complained upon delivery but dealer said brakes were set correctly.
When pressing the brake pedal, it is easy to also be pressing the gas pedal accidentally. I just take extra care.
Has specified to 'stay right' when the exit that needs to be taken is to the left , and it says to 'exit left' far too late to safely exit left. Complained to dealer and they stated it is 'google's fault'. It also likes to direct me onto dirt roads, or tries to route me onto a road that does not exist, or is gated off . Takes me to the wrong location, community of homes behind the baseball field for example, instead of to the large baseball park address I gave it.
The entertainment system sometimes automatically switches into Pandora mode and out of whatever mode I was in. This happens occasionally - but usually within 2 minutes of starting up the vehicle. Since I am not signed up with Pandora, when it switches to Pandora, all of a sudden the music just goes away until I look over and see that it has auto-switched into Pandor again!
small crack on windshield
once in a while makes a squeaking noise.
When I turn on my fog lights below the headlights, once in a while one side doesn't turn on but when I try couple time, it will comes on.
: The height adjustment of the driver's seat is adequate for most, except very short people . Even when adjusted to the lowest, the driver's feet are not at the most comfortable position.
Dent on drivers door in two spots.  Was assured they would get taken care of. That has yet to happenb yr
Hard to find in navigation system
Hard to find.  Hard to connect phone to
Na
I hang a pendant on the rear-view mirror, hang swing when driving, then the collision to the windshield make a clips.
I don't understand the vehicle pressure system.  Is it automatic?  There are very specific suggestions for pressure but if I overinflate the tires it seems to deflate them to the proper pressure.  ????  Who knows.
I am supposed to be able to walk up the drivers door without my key in my hand but in my pocket and put my thumb on the handle and have the door open.  No matter how close the key is this often doesn't work.  it's frustrating.
I have no idea how to reset the trip computer easily.  I have looked it up in the manual and surfed online with no luck.  it's weird.  I often will reset the trip computer for short trips but I dont know how to do it.
I have no idea what lights and options need to be on in order to activate the BMW self parallel park feature.  Some days it works and some days it doesn't.
: This one is more of an iPhone issue but when I plug my phone in to the charger port it automatically starts playing music form my iPhone even though I rarely want that.  There is no way to disable this.  It would be great if I could just use the BMW USB port as a charger port but often I dont even use it anymore and instead use a 3rd party power adapter that doesn't have this auto play functionality.
Overall the navigation system is basically useless. Between not being able to determine route because of poor contrast, navigating the menus is hard too.  To top it off, most of the features are disabled once you start moving.  Much more so than any other vehicle I have ever had.  it's horrible.  Why not jsut pass through the navigation from my iPhone like Waze.  Why try to compete because the BMW system sucks.  To top it off the prompts are always late and you can never tell what the next tip is so you often miss turns in LA because there are 6 lanes of traffic and you can't navigate over to an exit in ""200 yards"".  Lame!  This is not an issue the dealer can fix.
Front windshield just seems to fog up more than any other car I have ever owned.  Not sure why.
They squeak and make noise. I'm thinking they are still being broken in as I don't use the brakes often due to the regen stopping feature of the car.
the materials show any hand or arm marks and are difficult to remove
: Occasional awful metal grinding sound. Known issue with rocks caught between rotor and beside shield. Happens occasionally.
: Illuminated door sill not working in one side, uneven lighting on the other.
Inconsistent. Sometimes voice recognition works great, other times it is bad.
: The amp blew without any music or sound playing.  After that I had zero sound coming from car.  BMW said that they have repaired the problem and it was a known problem.
Previous BMWs were quiter
BMW used to be great with steering wheel feel. All my other BMWs were great with steering wheel feel which is why I bought them. Now feels like I'm driving a Honda or GM product. Very float-y feel. Horrible.
seems like it needs an alignment already.
There seems to be no 'off' button. Just mute. system screen stays on even after car turned off.
Lost the ability to match both zones with one control. Previous BMW allowed you to control both zone temp with one dial if desired.
I have not talked to dealer trying to see if maybe it is my phone
: Artificial leather smells
Hear a very loud squeal when coming to a stop from time to time and it's not the brakes, it sounds like suspension. Only happens once and then I don't hear it again.
heated steering wheel button on the steering column where you cannot see it.
it's just weird when it closes because the wind itself has no frame like my other cars. This one the top frame of the window is attached to the car so when you close the car, you don't want to close with your hands touching the top of the glass  . - it just feels weird and a bit unsafe -
no comment : the issue is that if i ever have an issue with blue tooth - the connection port does not read my phone well
It takes a while to load mis-represents commands or requests - a lit of the issues are that Siri is not very smart...
it;s not a problem - it just is not very comfortable to take out that extra seating area with the thigh support feature - but it is pretty cool just could be better to expand. - seems a bit clumsy but maybe because this is a new feature- i still love this car- it is my 3rd BMW
Does not latch without force.
Called dealer. Stated will attempt to repair.
I've owned BMW for 40 years and I feel that the material is thinner and the it wrinkles on the bottom cushion.
The center console is a arm rest as well as a cover of the storage box. It should of been made a little stronger so that it doesn't flex as much.
Slow air leak
Tries to pair when no device is turned on and prevents use of voice command of other features
More than a defect, this is the quality of tires that BMW cars are shipped with. The Bridgestone run flats are very noisy and are only great in extreme summer. I had a similar issue in my previous bmw and when I changed to good quality Michelin super sports, the whole experience was different! I wish BMW gave great tires especially for a car like mine which is a 340i M Sport.
Phone has to have specific phone case to operate with the car play
There is a static or popping noise during connectivity
Took it back to BMW and they lubed the door seals and it stopped the squeaking
After applying handbrake when parking, it always goes back about a few inches
Washer was disconnected from box inside the hood.
They don't always turn off after you've made a turn.
The system doesn't recognize  names in my phone book.
At most normal positions, steering wheel partially obscures display
Design of double doors and automatic spring opening feature means doors require considerable force to close...
Very little difference in pressure required for short signal or long signal...
Click on/click off should be same movement, not back on and forward off.  Annoying...
Automatic dipping at night is often slow to respond to bright light...
Bluetooth pairs and works well but we have multiple phones and it gets confusing identifying specific phone to connect/is connected...
Tucked away and difficult to locate and utilize.  Just bad design... : When folding rear seat, belt buckle can easily dig into seat bottom and leave mark/ potentially cut into it.  Bad design - just have to remember to slide buckle all the way to the top, which should not be necessary...
When I use the remote opener for the tailgate door it gets stuck sometimes and doesn't open on its own.
When using the high beams, they light up far ahead of me but I have difficulty seeing the road right in front of me. It's actually dark directly in front of car.
It is difficult to get the lid of the storage console to unlatch and open.
Frequently totally misunderstands what was said.
May be due to increased engine size and turbo when compared to older Countryman.
The center console is placed badly. If it's down, my elbow hits it every time I shift gears, and if it's up, my elbow hits it when I put on the parking break and when I look behind me when parallel parking.
: The tailgate kick feature to open the tailgate doors isn't working.
I have purchased a total of 9 tires for three MINI vehicles . I don't think these are well made tires.
I've tried setting the presets a few times and they still don't seem to stick. Also, doesn't seem like two people can stay connected through bluetooth at the same time.
: When playing music from iPhone connected via USB or Bluetooth the display doesn't display the music that is currently playing. Does not occur very frequently and usually is fixed if I disconnect and reconnect the iPhone
Foot sensor seems intermitent  Doesn't seem to work all the time
poor location and hard to buckle
hard to see into it  to far back
have to reach around the shifter
HARD TO SLIDE BACK AND FORTH-- NOT THE SMOOTHEST
BUCKLE LOCATED DEEP INN SEAT AND DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE INTO AND REQUIRES EXTRA STRENGTH
Delivered in winter; when placing heater in high it makes excessive noise! I'm assuming it will do the same with the air conditioning.
Called Dealership, attempted to fix over phone and reset.... didn't work, taking the car - in the next week to see about getting it fixed.
Even when I am standing directly in front of the rear hatch, I often have to push the key fob several times before the latch releases.
I do not do a lot of driving under highway conditions so it was a probably a month after I took delivery that I drove over 50 miles per hour.    This is when I first experienced the noise which is substantially louder if the highway is also wet.
see previous comment
First, the ports are very difficult to access being recessed like they are and because of their location.  Also, they are somewhat blocked by the gearshift.
Difficult to clean w/ a vacuum cleaner so as to get all of the dust and small particles out.
The vents do not do the greatest job of cooling the car.  They are a pain to adjust.
When the fan is above low speed it is very hard to hear anything, including the radio, phone or conversation, above the noise of the fan.
: The rear door is supposed to be hands freee, but it does not consitantly work. When I kick my foot under the licencse plate and about 30% of the time it works and opens the doors.  The car was brand new when purchased and is only 3 months old.  It is disappointng that this feature does not consitantly work.  At this point, since it only works about 30% of the time I do not really use it any more.  I have not had time to take it to the dealer.  I will try that when possible.
It seems to be related to the Pirelli run-flat tires that came standard on the vehicle. After doing research online, it seems many others have experienced the same issue.
Horn would honk on it's own after turning left then straightening wheel
It's a strange clicking noise. But it's pretty quiet and definitely comes and goes. I haven't quite figured out what triggers it yet.
I had little white specks on the convertible top.
It just a pain to use because it just doesn't understand what you're saying.
The menu system is to complicated.
Hard to reach to insert buckle.
doesn't blow hard enough even on highest setting
AC leaking inside car 
The turn signal is very sensitive. I barely touch it and it changes from left turn signal to right turn signal.
I would prefer to have more light in the trunk, above the felt trunk cover.
For the most part my phone and the mini cooper sync but there are random times when it doesn't pair up automatically.
For someone like me that goes to the beach a lot, it is difficult to keep the sand out and it's hard to clean when it gets in between the seams.
Too many setting selections. I don't know how to operate it.
The door panel material gets scuff up easily, especially when you get out of the car and you barely tap the door with your shoe.
The controls and displays are not ergonomically located and convenient to use.
The red background or lighting makes it very difficult to see or use in the night. Bright lighting would be very helpful.
The center rear portion of the hood flex and pop with light hand pressure when hand washing the SAV.  Also, I took my first road trip  and it seems that hood was flexing intermittently at speeds around 80 mph.
Waving foot under does not work for me.  Works for wife every time
Hard to lock belt since angle of buckle is awkward.  May get easier with time
In the way of cargo.  Should lift away in all sections
It seems as if the back tailgate stops before it has gone all the way up when I'm using the key fob--perhaps I need to hold it down longer?  Also, at times it is difficult to operate using the foot/external motion sensor and I end up using the key fob.  The manual latch in the door is the easiest, most reliable option to use.
Not difficult as in too tight, but sometimes it seems resistant to coming off when I'm refueling.
It is difficult to locate a point of interest-I live near San Francisco and was looking for a hotel-the Ritz Carlton.  When typing in Ritz Carlton, the first options that popped up were in other states and countries.  I end up using my iphone and Google Maps.  I like the heads up display with navigation features, but the map on the navigation screen is hard to use/read while driving, and often gives time estimates that are 10+ minutes off of my Waze/Google maps estimate-often it's less reliable.
It is difficult to get the A/C to blow in the middle setting, it seemed as though I had to select Max A/C to do this until I spent some time with the manual--without Max A/C the air flow for A/C seems anemic in this middle setting.
I think it is something to do with the speakerphone in the car-almost like a crackling squeak.
not a lot of storage space, not super easy to get to
poor location for all cupholders in the 2017 BMW X1
There are two modes. A light touch activates the signal for three ""blinks."" A harder touch activates a continuous signal. Often, to be safe, three blinks is not enough, however if you activate the continuous signal, you have to push the signal arm the opposite direction. For me, when changing lanes, almost every time, it causes the signal to activate indicating a turn in the opposite direction.
The only part of this new car I do not like is the navigation system. The operating steps and control are counter-intuitive. There are not enough options for screen options. I would like to be able to set the display to show speed, time to next turn, distance to next turn, what road or exit the next turn is, and would like it to allow display of my favorite pints or addresses. Also, turn information is often prompted at too late a point to safely move over lanes if needed. I have reverted to using my phone and google maps. It is unfortunate that a $40k+ Car does not have a better - and safer, navigation system.
Larger travel mugs are difficult to place and remove at the angle and location of the cup holders. I have spilled trying to maneuver items in and out of the front cup holders. Minor issue.
I noticed scuffing immediately on lower-inner door panel.
: foot activating rear tailgate does not work all the time
I have only been able to manually open the 'trunk' of this car 1 time; always have to use the fob
This vehicle has a constant growl/engine noise...reminds me of a diesel actually; when I back out of my drive way in the morning the noise is alarming; it seems to settle down after I begin driving...not all the noise
I don't know what else to say; I did research -after I bought it unfortunately- and it is listed at #14 of the top 30 loudest vehicles.  It is a very loud ride
The kick sensor does not work properly.
Parking break goes on easily, but does not disengage the first time it is pushed.
Trouble with Apple Car Play synching to play lists.  Could not get an appointment with Genius.
: engine shut down at car wash
I can only compare the braking effect to that of my former vehicle, a 2005 Volvo V70, but it seems the BMW does not slow down as quickly as I would expect with the brake pressure applied.  I often end up pressing the brake pedal harder than I would expect to come to a complete stop.  It may be something I just need to adjust to.
In order to use the horn, you have to remove one  hand from the steering wheel as the horn is located in the center of the steering wheel.  It would be more convenient to have a horn button where it could be reached by a thumb without releasing the wheel.
This is the first vehicle I have owned that has the voice recognition feature, so the problem may be my lack of experience with using the system.  There have been several times when the system receives information that is not what I asked for.  For example, the name of the person I want to call is not correct, or the location I want to navigate to is not what I asked for.  There was one time I wanted navigation directions, and it came up with the name of and a phone number of a person rather than driving directions.
When the defrost button is pressed, the fan goes into high speed which is so loud the audio system can't be heard.  It does a very quick job of defrosting the windshield, though.  I usually just turn down the fan.
Hands free trunk opening is pretty difficult. No matter how I do it, it won't work. I've reached out to the dealership to get some more ""training"" but  still almost impossible to get it to open. So I stopped using that feature.
could not transfer existing music stored on previous X3 leased BMX to new X1
Motion sensor doesn't always work
This may be operator error, me!  But I can't seem to get the rear wiper to keep wiping all the time, only intermittent so maybe it is me not turning it on correctly, but I have tried. Also, it would be great if the sweep of the rear window could be larger but it is NOT imperative, just a suggestion.
Can only get it to run intermittently. Would like it to run all the time if I need it.
Being on the steering column below the steering wheel makes it hard to find and then to see if it's on or not. Please move.
When lowering the 2nd row passenger side window, it squeaks.
the Dash and center console. looks worn already
USB/charge port failed. Warranty fixed.
During a rain storm, the wipers became stuck on low speed whenever the car was running. No other function of the wipers worked. I left the vehicle at the dealer the following morning which was a Friday. They gave me a loaner car at no cost until the repairs were completed. The wiper switch was broken and stuck on low. The repair required a wiper switch which had to be ordered. They originally told me it would be Tuesday or Wednesday before the vehicle was repaired. The part came in on Monday and the dealer put a rush on the repair and it was completed Monday afternoon. I picked up the vehicle late Monday afternoon.
the pulley seems a bit maladjusted so the belt turns inside the mechanism and doubles thus making it lock inside the tracker device designed to hold it flat
Probably interefering with apple sync function. Need to troubleshott further
Blind spot monitors don't work unless car is above 30 mph...Not explained at purchase...Think they should work at lower speeds as well...
Have to struggle to close...takes some strength to get to latch.
ITS JUST BAD AT RECOGNIZING WORDS AND ADDRESSES even names for hands free dialing.
The placement of the blind spot indicators is not intuitive, they are located below the mirror and would be better if they were in the mirror as many other types of vehicles have.
Excessive noise coming from rear seat vent when air conditioning is on.
The vehicle looks like It has had a bad repair job? Misaligned hood and doors.
Looks like the vehicle has had a bad repair job. Gaps and alignment just look off.
The entire vehicle vibrates like a cheap motel bed. Most noticeable at or above 70 MPH.
Have return to the dealer twice now. They had it for two weeks and returned it saying this was normal because of the sport package on the vehicle.
One in the glove box  the other inside center console. Neither is convenient.
Car Play does not work at all. Had two different loaner cars that were 2017 X5 also and they work fine.
Routinely have to use my phone for navigation. the car constantly takes me in circles with constant u-turns??
Does not work with Car Play mode.
Takes forever to get kids buckled up in back seat because the belts lock up when pulled out just a short way. Same problem with the drivers seat, but not as often.
I couldn't figure out how to open it. The release latch isn't easy to find and in a good location.
It's very hard to open. I have to squeeze the handle several times and it won't always open, so I will then have to use the lever in the driver seat arm rest. It's also a very heavy door so hard to lift.
You have to push it a few times for it to close and it doesn't always stay closed.
The plastic cover the front window not flush to the front window glass on the passenger side. A dent on the rear door on the driver side. The gape of the rear door and the body on the passenger side large enough to fit an index finger. Rear camera till down to where the license plate is visible in the dashboard view when put on reverse.
The plastic that cover front windows at the bottom is not flush onto the glass on the passenger side. The gap on the rear door and the body on passenger side is large enough to fit an index finger.
The dents is visible when look from angle view. The paint is fine
The gaps between the rear door on passenger side is large enough to fit an index finger when closed
the mirror was shattered but the dealership ordered and replaced it 2 weeks later
Up/down function isn't clear to keep wipers on.
Radio apps are hard to sync up.
I find them too narrow to step on. I'm tall enough to not need them but find that I have to really stretch to get around them.  They easily make clothes dirty in bad weather.
Originally the dealer had the wrong floor mat , the current one moves after a couple of  days. The Velcro system is not good enough for a car this expensive.
Sometimes the system does not pick up my Pandora station and sometimes it does. Sometimes it works off of my IPhone, and other times pairing to Pandora. Very confusing.
Paint imperfection on hood of vehicle.
sometimes doesn't listen or work for me and get really annoying
just doesn't recognize the phone
It is fine around town, but on the highway because it is low to the ground with run flats it is noisy.  It is the design, not a maintenance issue.
It didnt have the typical new car smell, especially considering that the interior is leather. I am thinking that it maybe the steering wheel, which is made from a different material than my 2014 3 series BMW
It only seems to happen when I start the car and am backing out of the garage. If I step on the brakes they squeal. After driving the car, if I back up while parking or to exit a parking space, I don't hear the squeal. This is another problem I will bring to the attention of the dealer when I make an appointment.
The system doesn't recognize street names or points of interest even when I know the points of interest are there. The car is very new to me and I may be requesting the name or place incorrectly but it is frustrating and difficult. I have not gone to the dealer yet because this is another thing I want to clarify.
I find it difficult to enter an address. Voice recognition often misunderstands my commands. There is a knob to turn to select letters to enter an address but it is clunky.  Once I have entered the address, I can save it but I have trouble naming the address . I haven't gone to the dealer yet because it is fairly far away and I want to go with a lot of navigation and audio questions to ask at one time.
On the passenger side there is a button where you can select which vent you want air to come out of: upper vent only, middle vent only, floor vent only, two of the three or all three. The selection for top vent does not work. When I go to the dealer to ask my other questions, I will address this problem. It is not crucial at the present time.
Doesn't have auto lift and is awkward to open
The voice activation feature is great. The difficulty arises when everything is loaded and it actually starts directing you. If you need to change something or need more infomation on the screen, you can get very frustrated and confused when you try to have the system give you what you need. It's not a user friendly program. Also it does not handle toll roads very well. It keeps trying to go around them.  Even though, I will say, seeing the directions displayed on the dash right in front of the steering wheel is a nice additional option. I probably need to go into the dealership and have them explain how to better use the navigational system. The
trying if phone is problem.
At the B Pillar the black trim is slightly off on each side. But I saw another M2, it had the same issue. Not significant, but I paid $72K out the door for the car, expected perfection on the build.
I have the BMW M-Performance Exhaust . After a track day the exhaust slides forward and rattles terribly on startup. Brought to the dealer, problem reoccured twice . The clamp keeps coming loose. Also since Day 1 the M-Performance Exhaust has a slight rattle on cold-start. This is a known issue, they are supposedly correcting this for future buyers.
The location of the guidance control knob is too close to passenger seat. There should be a locking mechanism on the control knob.
Wi-Fi has not been operational
: When phone connected via Bluetooth the audio can sometimes be VERY distorted
Strange location, adjacent to 12 v power port
The door seals on all 4doors squeak like a fat guy in leather pants when the car flexes going up a ramp, driveway, speedbump, or anything that twists the vehicle.  Dealer stated they couldn't replicate the issue.
Leak in the tire during first few days upon receipt.  Dealer fixed, unsure if was a mounting issue or road defect that happened to occur n the first 50miles, but seems unlikely.
: Poor audio quality via Bluetooth audio.
It was fixed after it was reported but still was not working after the ""repair""
Likely a fuse out.  Will have the dealer fix at first maintenance interval.
Cannot download and store cd's to the cd system. It is much harder than my 750Li series. Not self explanatory : Only downloading ths cd's to the memory
Some times it now works good
too many steps
Brakes almost sound like there is sand on the brake pads which is rubbing - really bad backing up.
The speed that is set for cruise is impossible to see when driving the car. . . unless I lean forward 1-2'.  Really annoying!
The driver information screen on the dashboard is too small an is totally obstructed by the steering wheel where I have it positioned.  This particularly problematic when trying to see the speed setting for cruise.  It is the single biggest design failure in the car.  If that 1'x2' box were at the top of the screen instead of the bottom, there would be no issues.  This design flaw is really irritating .
: It seems that the 3G service was constantly updating making it difficult to get to some services in a timely manner.
In the front seat, the cup holders in the center console are difficult to reach, require tipping to get in  and don't fit some containers.  The door holders - both front and back don't hold any containers effectively.  Everything that gets put into those spaces falls down, slides around and makes noise.
I'm extremely meticulous with keeping my car clean and any little brush/touch of most of the interior materials causes scuffs .
Noise starts when I initially start vehicle
The sensor works sporadically so it's difficult to rely on using it!
It's difficult because if I want to open the rear door for a kid or to put my bags, I have to touch the front door handle first... why? Why can't the back door just open when I touch the back handle?  Also, the sensor for the back hatch to open when I swipe my foot under the car for the sensors - works sporadically
The cup holders are too far forward to make it easy to use. They are also too close together  so the cups in the holders hit each other and clang.
Multiple times when entering or existing the car because of the location I hit the change seat control in error.
The center storage between seats is difficult to use based on the placement- it is too far back.  Also- there should be a divider in the center to help make the space more user friends.
In addition to being in a poor location the cup holder could be slightly deeper to help stabilize the bottles/cups.  Also- when pulling them out you almost have to tip taller sizes because there is no overhead space because of where it is placed.
Cannot locate sensor consistently
Lasted only first month or so. Now there is no smell.
the truck button is in an awkward and hard to find place.  It is not convenient.
same as on former page
Has a hard time hearing numbers
: The car has frozen three times and I haven't been able to get it into gear.  I have been advised to step very hard on the brake to correct this.  So far, it has always worked to do this.  I always step on the brake when starting the car, but possibly not hard.
It's easier to put the location in my phone GPS than the car as it's so slow to operate and find locations.  By the time I type in the address, I could already be driving and using my phone GPS.
Need additional info available in owners manual...
Voice commands are diffucult to set dealing with navigation system...
: Somewhat weak bluetooth signal that impacts audio quality. This happens infrequently. Hasn't occured in awhile.
Only happens occasionally
Yellowish hue
I have bonnet racing stripes .  dirt or bugs that have hit the stripe leave a permanent mark
Its more difficult that GM systems to figure out how to store home locations.  Traffic flow system are also not as good as GM when their system is integrated with Satellite Nav/Traffic features
Low level rattle/buzz.  Hard to pinpoint where within the dash assembly
The floor attachment point for the mat gives back a feeling of not well fixed to the floor if you happen to step or rest your foot on it
Just an odd smell of new materials in a car.  I have had other new cars and they smell better
The ""new car smell"" was very strong, to the point of being unpleaseant
: when phone connected via blue tooth, radio stopped working
I have driven other brand cars that have much easier and more user friendly  GPS NAV systems.  I'm sure once I get used to the somewhat awkward way of entering and engaging a route I will get used to it.
Small tare in driver seat dealer fixed fast and free : I had a small tear In the drivers seat noticed first night took back to dealer and they fixed it free and fast
It's in the right place but the rim of it gets in the way of pressing it. Plus, I've had to press hard to honk. I've never experienced that with my previous cars: Sierra truck,Yukon, Ford Tempo, or Mazda Mpv. I guess I just have to get used to it.
The defroster works but it doesn't clear quickly.
I went through one of those car washes where you stay in the car.  there was one drip of water that was on the inside of the driver side window
it used to shut down when I came to a stop but it doesn't anymore.
They sometimes have a high pitch squeel when brake is allpied, when backing up.
The plastic component which covers the key slot fell off. I took the car to the dealership and the whole driver side handle was replaced.
Does not understand 'home'.
When the driver or passenger have their seatbelts on, it can be difficult to find the recline adjuster. When first getting the car I mistook the lumbar adjustment for the recliner because the recliner was hidden by the seatbelt.
The lowest setting is very hot - it heats up quickly which is great, but I do not keep in on for long.
The wheel cover panel lifts up easily and locks in place to put things in the hidden compartment below - but its difficult to close again.  It must be taken out and repositioned to close again.
: 1)  I try to turn off the proximity warnings associated with the Park Assist feature.   No way to turn it off permanently.  The alarm rings any time I go into a drive-through, or enter my garage.  Incredibly annoying 2)  Cruise control is adaptive, but allows far too much space between cars for normal traffic.  Can't set it to a shorter ""follow"" distance

Mis-interprets street names.   When I say ""call"", it sometimes pulls up another menu Inconsistently doesn't recognize certain names
Randomly doesn'[t recognize that the device is connected, and then won't connect the device when i try to do so.  Sometimes is corrected by turning the car off and on Restarts an iTunes playlist, instead of continuing from the place where I was listening before I got into the car.  Again, this just randomly happens
appears to be the center section of the wooden dashboard around the Nav screen
: left outside mirror has dropped down when engaging the car in Reverse three or four times since purchase.  Nobody knows why - should never happen
I have a rotator cuff problem, so doing anything with a screen is painful, and I haven't achieved competence in making the voice commands work.  Need to go to school on that one - as there is no manual to read
The controls for memory seats are not recessed enough.  My knee hits the SET button frequently, and I get a message to fix the problem.  I have received that message abot 20 times in 2000 miles.  Tired of it,  No fix except to tuck those controls away so a random knee does not change the setting
: In cooler weather, the area of my left leg is consistently too cool.  Will have to figure out why, but have not done so yet. I discovered within days of delivery that I will have to install a 3M or similar film to keep from being cooked in the car. For 90 big ones, BMW should do that in Texas without asking.
It is truly a glove box, as nothing else but a pair of gloves can fit in it.  No room for any of the various manuals, and just barely enough room for a small packet of Kleenex.
I find the car more difficult to enter and exit than the Lexus LS 430 I owned - mostly because seats are lower and headroom is tighter.  So shoes come in contact with the inside of the door, and my left side back pocket buttons scrape the seat leather on every exit.  Shoes hit the inside door panel on both entrance and exit.  Good news is the spots seem to be easy to clean off.  That seat is so low that BMW needs to put a hand assist pad, like the Porsche, on the inside of both front seat doors.
There is no manual intermittent wiper control.  In it's place is an 'auto' function.  The auto function is terrible, hardly ever correct at determining when the windshield needs wiping.  WHEN YOU ADD A NEW AUTO FEATURE, DO NOT DELETE THE MANUAL CONTROL UNTIL THE 'AUTO' FUNCTION IS FLAWLESS!!  Also the windshield wiping pattern is poor.  The sweep of the right windshield wiper ends right in the middle of the driver's prime vision area.  And somehow, this ends up always leaving a little smudge on the windshield at that exact spot.  Hard to describe, and not devastating -- 6 out of 10 on the annoyance scale -- but I would have hoped for better.
The worst problem with the car.  The tailgate keeps opening erratically -- presumably because the button is being activated inadvertently while the key fob is in my pocket.  A few weeks ago, I returned to my car after a stroll in downtown Truckee, CA to find my tailgate wide open, showing all of my luggage and other belongings!  The key fob has a range of at least 40 yards, so it must have happened half way down the block when I bent over to pet a dog.  There is currently no way to disable this, although the obvious and easy solution is to add a 'disable' entry to the existing menu for the tailgate button.
Not sure if this is the correct area for this problem, but here goes.  Control of the instrument panel lighting is terrible -- this includes the climate control display as well.  During twilight or other intermediate lighting conditions, things go crazy.  For example, the speedometer and tach are lit, but the needle on the gas gauge is left dark, effectively making it disappear in the dimming ambient light.  As mentioned previously, there are many times that the climate control is totally unreadable.  There appear to be two problems -- 1) each component has its own idea of how dark it is, so some items adjust their brightness while others don't, and 2) the calibration on the outside ambient light detector is totally bogus, causing the instrument panel lighting to adjust in a completely incomprehensible manner -- usually dimming the display way too early given the current sunlight conditions.  
: Two issues: 1) It works in 2 degree F increments, should work in 1 degree increments. 2) Control of the brightness of the climate control display is abysmal.  Problem happens at twilight or other 'intermediate' light situations.  The system dims the display -- thinking it's dark, I suppose -- but the end result is that the display is so dim as to be unreadable.
Too slow, often poor recognition, poor/inconsistent menu structure.  For instance, I can use voice input for numbers if I give the audio 'street number' command, but cannot use voice input if I push the 'street number' menu selection.
The small 'glove box' type storage box on the far left of the dashboard is slightly misaligned, making it hard to easily open.  A minor problem.
Same issue as previous page.
Milky area in paint that looks like a buffing problem from the factory, I will have the dealer address when its in for service.
Rear exhaust sometimes rattles on start up, then goes away when warm.
When coming to a stop there is a vibration.
There is a lot of brake dust
Seems BMW's front windshields tend to fog up when starting the car...
Again, speedometer is not real calibrated to tell u how fast you are moving.  It needs a digital speedo. : Gauge cluster hard to read, no digital speedometer avail.
: The amount of air coming out rear vents is very low, so does not heat or cool enough.
: The amount of air coming out rear vents is very low, so does not heat or cool enough.
Poor braking.  Brakes nodt surrfciently large.  Replaced std. brakes with M-brakes-expensive.  ?DThis solved problem.  Original brakes worse than '99 528 brakes.  Bmw should fix problem.
The indicator light on my side mirrors is not very bright. It is especially difficult to see on a sunny day.
Whenever I set my drivers seat position, if automatically reverts back to a setting my husband made when we first got the car. It being my car, I have tried several times to re-set the seat position to mine, but it won't change
I have tried using the navigation system a few times verbally and it usually does not get the correct name or street address.  I end up using my cell phone which responds to verbal commands much better.  I also find that the system responses are difficult to hear when driving with the window open
When I initially start the car after it has been sitting in the hot Florida sun the A/C pressure is very low.  Until I'm driving for a while and at an accelerated speed the A/C doesn't kick on to full pressure to cool down quickly.
: the interior trunk release is located in an extremely inconvenient location way down on the left of the driver's side practically in the footwell, not far above from the hood release.  It's a fine location for the hood release, which is not frequently used, but the trunk release is a commonly used feature and should be more conveniently located either higher up on the driver's side or somewhere on the center stack or console.  Even a glove-box located trunk release is preferable to the present location.
rear brakes have a backing plate that gets rocks and debris caught it in it that causes loud scraping, scratching metal sound that is horrendous.  The company apparently has a third version of the backing plate upgrade at this point but according to my dealer, my vehicle was built and shipped with the most recent version of the backing plate.  Suggested that I gently bend the backing plate by hand to release any rocks or pebbles that get caught and cause the scraping, scratching sound.  Common problem.
Once programmed the seat does not save the adjustment, and if by chance it does work it doesn't adjust to the new driver. We have not spoke. To the Gemious about it so it may be user error.
Difficult to see HUD with polarized sunglasses, which I always wear during daytime driving.
Always connects, but sometimes music audio works, sometimes it doesn't. When it doesn't, I have to plug in via USB. Phone calls always work. Just audio. There are other misc Bluetooth bugs as well related to audio. For example, if I get a call while listening to music, sometimes the song resumes where it left off; sometimes, it starts at the beginning. The screen frequently loses album art, as if the phone reconnected. When attempting to scroll through songs with wheel on steering wheel, often times, the HUD will say something like searching, only to return nothing. Usually works after second attempt. Generally speaking Bluetooth audio is buggy.
the steering wheel made a groaning sound at times when turning, usually noticeable at low speeds. I took the car to BMW service who replaced a part on the steering column and the problem was solved.
I will ask it to call certain people in my contacts or to call ""Home"" and it will  not recognize any numbers, at times.
averaging 16 mpg city driving, using AC often
Notices significant noises on the first warm day when the car sat in the sun for the afternoon.  The noise seemed to get worse as the HVAC started to cool the car and then totally disappeared after the temperature inside the car normalized.
Difficult to understand exactly how to activate the system. Button must be pressed, car driven slowly, not certaiwhen it finds a parking space. Just generally difficult to use.
at times, upon starting vehicle driver belt will not release,  until vehicle is out of parked mode
I simply can't understand when my vehicle is in ""standby"" or ""off"". Very frustrating.
At times the caller and recipient have totally muffled voices. When I hang up and call again the problem usually clears.
Wind noise at highway speeds disappointing
Road noise excessive for this price range/quality car
: Brakes seem to thump when releasing upon braking hard. Could be normal part of design since both 7 's I have leased have done this. Excessive drifting at highway speeds, hard to keep centered in lane, lane correction constantly engaging. Did not notice drifting on previously owned 750. Previous car seemed to require less effort to maintain in lane. This is my biggest disappointment in this vehicle. This drifting becomes fatiguing and tiresome when on long road trip
Annoying to use. Haven't figured out how to turn off
Hard to distinguish symbols designating heat or cool fromeach other
: Sometimes bumping feeling on acceleration from standing still. Both 7's that I leased did this. Could be normal part of design
the seats are a bit tight
the leather seats kind of smell little unpleasant but its not too bad though
: Kick activated hatch doesn't always respond to my kicks under the bumper.
: Memory seat setting is not governed by the key used to enter the vehicle.
No comment
Small storage compartment to the left of steering wheel constantly jams and won't open.
Too small for YETI cups
Squeaks/rattles in passenger seat when not occupied.  Sporadic.
While stopped at a light the car sometimes starts and stops several times.
5/15/17 BMW NW  IS WORKING ON REPLACING MY FRONT PASSENGER DOOR HANDLE AND WORKING ON FIX THE DRIVER REAR PASSENGER INSIDE DOOR PANEL. ITS MISALIGNED.? THANKS
I've had this feature before in other cars, but this one is hard to use, won't always work and is difficult to understand. It worked one time for me and I have not been able to get it to work again.
: Rain sensor for windshield wipers is extremely sensitive.  As a result, there is no intermittent speed -- either the wipers are on or their off, regardless of the setting.  This is a known issue with BMW wipers.
It's just annoying.  Two pieces; hard to put on and take off.
: I open the tailgate to get some things in or out. Sometimes tailgate closes itself unexpectedly.
I wish this vehicle has more reduction from outside noises: I can hear noise from tires and noise from loud vehicles driving nearby. It is not that terrible, but I wish noise reduction would be better: minus few dB's.
on the driver side I can see the inside of the door
It is too difficult to hit it. Too hard and in poor location to hit it
It is hard to understand how to turn on the ac and bring the power up
It is reaping off on driver side. seems like not a good quality
inaccurate whereas other smartphione gps are superior
Use of foot to open lift gate is a challenge
Jean materials scuff/stain the seats.
marks appear on dashboard easilu
hands free opening is problematic -- works sometimes, doesn't work other times  -- generally takes several attempts.  You have to be in the PERFECT position.
excessive"" is a strong term, but there is a bit more road noise than I expected
controls not intuitive
hands free tailgate entry usually opens, but takes several tries; drivers door finger touch pad doesn't work for me, but works for Lori; windshield wiper controls are not intuitive
The interior button is located on the driver door and is awkward to me. The button on the key chain has to be held down for a prolonged time to engage
Cannot see the display with mileage & outside temperature. It is located behind the steering wheel and I have to sit up and look over the wheel if I want to glance at the info. Odd it is placed so low
: Volume on the speakers is very low until turned up past halfway
White leather seats pickup the color of my dress slacks easily. Need to clean the seats often
Only big enough to hold the manual. Even a small wallet won't fit in with the manual
Not alot of space to store anything
Insulated coffee cups too large for the cup holders. Even smaller cups that do fit it is awkward to place and remove a lidded beverage. Requires a tilt to place/remove the cup. Just weird to me
The connection with iPhone 7 is poor and disconnects all the time, this has not been solved by bmw yet
The intermittent setting is computer controlled.  There should be a manual control for the intermittent settings.  The computer does not do well in sleet and light snow.
The car should automatically unlock when put into park like all other cars.
When slowing down, it should not apply the brake.  I would rather coast down to the lower speed, saving gas and brake wear.
There should be a digital read out option
When plugging in a USB adaptor, it does not work in the front dash location but works in all the other locations.  After doing some research on your forum, I found out that you use two styles of plugs and the European style is a bit longer and won't work with American adaptors.  Why use two different styles of plugs in one car?  Why put a European style in a car that is built and sold in the US?
The pre-set stations are different from the preset buttons and the steering wheel button ""wheel"" handles the preset stations, but sometimes handles different presets.  Very confusing for a simple operation.
I don't understand why my seat does not automatically go to my setting when I enter the vehicle with my fob.
Hard to memorize how to change between backup cameras.  And doesn't tell me that it is searching for a space until it's already found one, so I can't always use it to parallel park.\
It's not clear where to place the foot in order for it to open. Out of the 20 times i tried it maybe it worked twice.
items easily slide out; may adive on either have it slighty tilted or with rubber mat/lip
I can not figure out how to turn on fog lights and really don't know if I have headlight height adjustment and wouldn't know how to adjust them if I did.
Rain sensor goes into hyper speed when it isnt neccessary, and doesnct slow down. Opted to not use it more often than not.
There doesnt seem to be any variation of hot for the 3 levels. They're all hot.
: Need to move seat up so i can engage the clutch and now this brings me me too close for accelerator and foot brake.
Vent option control is too low to use while driving. Its dangerous. Floor vent does not warm my feet. It's cold in NH.
The secret compartment above the glove box in previous models not in 2017. I miss it.
Side visor hits headrest of drivers seat when seat is raised. I have the seat moved fairly forward so there isn't enough clearance for the visor to be effective at all. Sad.
: Crackling sound when usimg bluetooth phone
Plastic center piece of the left foot rest  keeps falling out.
NOT SURE HOW I AM NO LONGER ABLE TO SEE FUEL CONSUMPTION BUT IT IS NO LONGER THERE.  I USED THE BOOK TO LOCATE HOW TO ADJUST IT AND THE STEPS DO NOT REFLECT WHAT THE MONITORSAYS TO DO, . . . LEAVING ME UNABLE TO CHNAGE OR ADJUST IT.
WHEN ENTERING THE CAR AND TURNING IT ON I HAVE TO ACCEPT AND CONNECT.  IT MAY GIVE ME A MESSGAE THAT IT CAN'T CONNECT OR IT MAY NOT.  ALSO, IF TALKING ON A CALL AND I STOP AND WANT TO LEAVE THE CAR THE CALL WON'T TRANSFER TO THE PHONE WHEN SELECTED AND MAY DROP THE CALL WHEN LEAVING THE CAR.
THE MATERIAL FOR THE FLOOR MATS HAS A BAD SMELL AND WHEN THE CAR ID HEATED IT REALLY SMELLS.
Vehicle makes more road noise than other vehicles we own.  Considering the price point that should not be the case.  My wife's Mercedes ML350 has much less road noise coming into the cabin
When accelerating engine over revs before shifting.  This does not happen often only rarely.
The tire lost pressure so the car's warning light came on.  Had to fill with air several times/
Darkening of mirrors almost prohibit vision : The drivers outside mirror and rear window turn a dark color and you can barely see outward in the dark
It does not necessarily leak into vehicle, however it pools inside the doors at the latch point and on the tailgate, it pools on the sides at the top, which when you open it, drips onto you before you are able to dry it.
The dealership said it was the roads!
It seems to be a sporadic issue
It may be the model, which is the Xline?  As the last X3 I had was a 2013
The rear wiper indicates wash on the top and bottom, it is confusing if you just want to use wiper to remove rain
If you do not have the traditional clock illustrated on center screen, the digital numbers on the right lower side of dash are difficult to see
will not power up phone charger
There is only the cig lighter in the front area of car.  My last X3 or my new X3 if never seems to work.  The outlet in the rear seat does not provide enough reach for the apple charge cord. to talk, if not on speaker
If my daughter drives my car, and switches to her Blue Tooth setting,   Upon entry I find it does not auto pair with mine, even though she is no where near with her phone.   I have to go through motions
It just seems as though there should be more insulation strips in the doors, as even when it rains, the inside area of doors not car, get wet, it is very noticeable when opening door to get out as it  drips out at times.
The storage compartment on the drivers side, left under steering wheel, does not seem to latch tightly, there are times I get in or out of vehicle, and bang my knee as it is dark, not lit and in a weird spot.
There was a blemish in the paint when it came from the factory. Gebhardt dealership fixed it!
I opened sun roof and it completely broke . Would not open or close . Dealer replaced motor and is fine now.
REAL TIME TRAFFIC NOT ENABLED WHEN PICKED UP.
trunk switch hard to press- does not react right away
It doesn't happen all the time but occasionally when I switch from Apple Carplay to Bluetooth it won't recognize my phone in the media section so I am not able to listen to my music from my phone.   Also when I am using Apple carplay and I try to use the Waze app on my phone it continuously switches from my satellite radio to apple carplay. Then I have to click back to my satellite radio. Once Waze gives another turn direction my satellite radio switches to apple Carplay.
Difficult to use and we have not invested much time to resolve the issue.  Sending maps to the car via google maps is much faster and easier than trying to get address information into the NAV system with voice commands. : We've never been able to use the voice commands with any measure of success.
The check engine light recently came on.  We are scheduling service to assess the problem.
Sometimes makes a squeaking noise when first opening in the morning.
sensor for opening trunk door with foot is temperamental and does not always open well.
air conditioning/defrost-excessive noise.
We told this to an agent for Mini that called and they said that fuel consumption would improve after 1000 miles but it really hasn't improved yet. Since I use the car for mostly city driving I cannot comment on mostly highway driving.
Bluetooth connectivity behaves inconsistently.  Sometimes it won't connect to my phone when I want it to.  Also, the GPS directions don't broadcast over the car speakers while using the radio, but it does broadcast over the car speakers while listening to music or podcasts from my iPhone.
AUTO button is confusing.  Don't know when it's on or off, and the light indicator doesn't seem to correspond to the fan speed. : Climate control system is confusing, in particular the ""AUTO"" button is confusing
: can never get the trunk open with the kick sensor feature
This has been a problem with the MINI brand for quite a long time.
Some of my wider width boots are actually hard to wear when driving the car.
Sometimes the car just forgets to connect to an external source.  Other times the car cannot determine which USB device to use.  Other times it defaults to Bluetooth.
One of the ports is in the center console, the other is just in front of the cup holders.  Difficult to work with both when the car is in motion.
I just cant seem to get the car to understand me.
The leather covering the main cushion seems to buckle a bit too easily.
The cover of the center console does not close frequently.  Usually need to apply some arm pressure to keep the latch secure.
The plastic panels on the lower side of the door - both driver and passenger - seem to scuff very easily.
The system has told me to exit off a highway and then get back on again.
There are devices in the cupholder that make it fit any cup, which is so great!!  However, they are just a little too tight...they require a little too much force to push a cup down into them, which usually results in a little spillage when the cup is full.  Maybe they will loosen a little over time.
Right rear brake light failure. The dealer discovered that the bulb was Ok, and the problem was in the assembly. Assembly was replaced and the problem was resolved.
This new LEMON 2017 mini with 250 miles, approx. 5 weeks old would not start when depressing the brake pedal and engaging the start switch.  Having a mechanical engineering back ground with GM Cadillac for 40 years I first checked the battery with my multimeter and found the battery was full  and all electrical worked fine but as described would not start.  The dealer picked it up and of coarse it started after stilling there over the weekend, found nothing wrong and driving the hell out of it, no codes flashed and did a software upgrade which I do not believe fixed anything and then gave the car back to us.  When checking with them they tell me there are no service bulletins or recalls related to this problem. Now my wife is afraid to go anywhere in it thinking it will happen again leaving her stranded.  I have been in talks with Mini customer service and seem to not care about finding the problem that caused the no start condition and will not accept not know what caused
The damn detent is too hard to engage and also to small compared to the older mini we had.  Once it is full depressed the lever moves find in all gears. It is just a cheap lousy design and my wife hates it, actually she has to use two hand to depress the detent.
: cloth on the back of front seats rips too easy
REX did not work the first time
preset station never works - don't know why.  If it is used incorrectly, it is definitely not intuitive.
when charging my phone with the usb port, it drops my calls and music from playing in the car on the car speakers
my phone automatically connects no problem and the music plays in the car from my phone, but when I plug my phone to charge it in the car, the music stops playing in the car and it will not reconnect.
very loud when in use
When purchasing a drink from a fast food restaurant, the cup does not fit in the cup holder the console in front tilts forward too much not allowing enough space for the larger cups to fit...
Rear doors in car are peculiar. Rear passenger cannot easily open door and get out without assistance from front passenger. : There is no clearly marked interior door handles. There is a pocket like structure in the door which we assume is supposed to be used like a door handle, but we are not sure and we don't want to pull it too hard for fear of breaking it.
Just hear noise, feel pressure on windy days.
Brakes squeal a lot when braking. Problem was very pronounced initially, but has now subsided to acceptable levels.
Not able to locate controls without manual. Not intuitive.
The door is supposed to automatically unlock when I approach the car with the key fob in my pocket and pull on the door handle. If I pull on the rear part  of the door handle, it takes many tries to open the door. I have to grab the front part of the handle (which has narrowest gap with the body of the vehicle to get the door to open on the first try.
I haven't looked at using cruise control because it is difficult to understand. Ideally cruise control should be the default/automatic at highway speeds when there is no congestion.
It is hard to close the glove box. Have to press real hard and even then there is no ""click"" indicating that glove box cover is closed properly
I have to wait a lot to get the temperature and sometimes i have to go down as 62, that is not normal
Times where Apple Play will not connect
It could be that I am just not used to the shifting of this new vehicle.
The paint was scratched on the right rear bumper.
Trunk is heavy to open. Easy to close. I have a hardtop convertible so that may explain why
In order to unlock passenger door I have to reach in car located in wrong place or I am missing something I will call Bmw for further information
I am surprised that for the price of a BMW the steering column is manually adjusted instead of power adjusted and automatically tilts away to enter and exit the car especially for a car this size that is low to the ground.
Street names not up to date. For example and major street leading to my subdivision was renamed over five years ago. The BMW navigation still has the older name which no longer is on the street signs. also found this problem when trying to find a location in another city. However, all are correct on Google Maps which I had to resort to on my iPhone.
Each side of dual controls always must be adjusted independently. No capability to allow setting temperature from driver side control when wanting the temperature to be the same for both sides. Requires too much distraction to look away from driving to set temperature for both sides--as well as annoying. I have had several cars with dual controls, Including Lincoln, Buick, Ford, Volvo an even Hyundai), and all have had this type of control--so I'm surprised that for the price of a BMW this feature is not provided. When I question this after I bought the car I was told that BMW didn't consider the car large enough to worry about this. However the Volvo C70 convertible I traded in had this feature.
: Transmission control is confusing--especially having to press a button for Park. Several times through habits of many years of driving I tend to push the shifter forward thinking it places the transmission in Park  to find that it actually is in reverse. This is dangerous. Since I alternate driving different vehicles  I must be careful to remember the strange way to put the BMW in Park. I have resorted to trying to use the hand brake. For this reason I probably won't keep the car long, and will not consider a BMW when I replace it.
When I was getting it washed at a gas station a couple months ago, water streamed down from the joint where the top meets the roof on the driver's corner. When I say stream, it wasn't dripping fast, it literally poured in and soaked my dress, seat and carpet. The few napkins I had in the car did little to help. I have had to get it hand washed since, which is a pain.
When wearing high heels where the heel's diameter isn't that large, it will get stuck under the gas pedal. Once you realize it has happened, it's a little scary knowing you have to spend a second or two trying to get it out while driving at high speeds down the highway.
Even though the address is correct, occasionally it will take me to somewhere a few blocks away. It makes me afraid to use it in important situations because of its inaccuracy.
Basically nothing besides a can of soda  or a 16oz bottle of water will fit in the front cup holders. Even a 20oz insulated container you have to wrestle with to get out and it hits the bottom of the radio when removing. I have tried at least 5 different varieties to see if any would work because I am in my car a lot and would like some water to stay cold for longer than a half hour.
Brake Pedal is too small
Probably the same issue, may be different, but cannot pinpoint where the noise is coming from.
Vibration/rattling is intermittent and not regular.  Waiting for it to become replicable to take to dealership.
: The rear seat continually dropped down when driving.  I brought it in for service and was informed the seats may not have ever been locked properly. I never attempted to drop the seats manually so this issue initiated upon receipt of the new vehichle.
Chip in paint at the front of the car.
Re the front bumper: I noticed this very shortly after delivery. It looks like there was a smudged fingerprint on the bumper after it was painted but before the clear coat was applied. While the bumper is not discolored, this shows up as a difference in the shine on the bumper. Gentle cleaning of the area made no difference, and the problem does seem to be beneath the clear coat. This is unsightly under certain light conditions.  Re The arm that holds the passenger side mirror to the body of the car: This part  is glossy black in color. I noticed after some use that there is abrasion in the clear coat on the leading edge of this arm. I noticed this while there were still very few miles on the vehicle.I have no recollection of any way in which this damage could have occurred following delivery. It is more likely that the problem existed at delivery, and I just never saw it .
As noted before : Shortly after taking delivery of the vehicle, the driver's side power lumbar support system failed. The lumbar support made noise as if it was working but did not inflate, causing the seat to have no lumbar support at all. This caused the car to be very uncomfortable to drive. The dealership's service department repaired the lumbar support system in this seat. The only issue I had with the repair was that it took 10 days or so for the dealer to get the required parts .
: The electronically controlled lumbar support mechanism in the driver's seat failed, making the car quite uncomfortable to drive.
Actually the problem is not the door sills per se -- there was no entry to mark for where the problem actually is . This is padded material that looks like leather. The area where the seatbelt buckle rests when the car is not in use is already abraded and unsightly. Given that I've not used this car very much yet, that is very surprising indeed.
Indicator light should be red, green, or any other color more visible. On a sunny day you can't see it.
missing streets and delayed when coming to the street to let you know. software needs to be upgraded
Airbag was recalled after one week
When putting the window up it goes half way up and then opens fully on its own. I have to try multiple times sometimes to ge the window to close completely.
Cannot tell when cooled seat function is on when it is relatively warm in the car.
I have yet to be able to open the trunk with with my ""foot"" when I have objects in my arms.
Using the parking assist camera when trying to parallel park-unclear why sometimes the system engages and not others.
Specifically, the Bluetooth connectivity with iPhone is atrocious. Does not always work as expected. The YouTube app will not always work with Bluetooth inside my BMW
To me, the steering wheel seems a little off center. I mentioned it to my wife  and she fails to notice it. It's negligible, so I didn't mention it.
Intermittent function difficult to regulate..either to quick or too slow.
: The hands free tailgate is difficult to figure out.
Intermittently doesn't connect
Sometimes Apple Car play will cause music to skip like a scratched CD player while listening to iTunes music and multitasking such as having the navigation up at the same time or using the back up camera.
: Very difficult to get the trunk to open using foot under sensors - have to press the latch every time. Once it opened without me trying to open it, just by standing near back of vehicle.
It never remembers my phone and I have to continuously pair it
The black leather is dull, not shiny and scuffs easily.
Not sure if it child car seats, but very irritating
Button in an unobvious place
I don't find the owners manual very understanding on this subject and the display is not intuitive like in my wife's infinity
not well explained in the owners manual
Bad factory amplifier
Isn't able to be programmed to unlock when put into park or engine shut off
It gets room temperature warm, should have a higher setting
eye does not seem to capture leg movement to release hatch door.
Need to use manual system most of the time.
Indicator comes on every time temperature drops, and I do not live in Alaska.
Same as previous question. Just not a user-friendly approach. Try it...
Anything but simple. Center instrument complicates things, I think.
Easy to smash your fingers.
Feels like it's going to brake any moment.
Owner's manual is actually not user-friendly.
I installed a car seat for my nephew today. The thing would almost not fit in spite of my efforts.
There is a very long lag between the time I press the accelerator  and the time the vehicle actually response to the driver input.
Incompatibility with audio apps only on the upgraded audio system 'XL' that work fine with the less expensive audio system
Controls for operating the windows could be moved a few inches forward so that is it possible to operate without having to reach backward
Road wear
Sweeping door under rear of car rarely opens hatch.
Options to use and enlighten information too hard to use and very very confusing
Set for 70 in summer and winter and fan blower never changes Other vehicles owned fan slows down dramatically oonceRequested temperature is reached
When I enable the security system and my iPhone 8 is in the same hand, it sets off the car alarm.  Seems to be some sort of compatibility issue.



A few times the heads up display has not turned on and I have not been able to do so from settings. I have not taken the car in for a check up yet
The previous X5 I owned  had a MUCH better nav system where it was much easier to tell where traffic was and for how long
I have found that in general the X% has a poor heating /cooling system and it takes too long to adjust. I have also noticed that the center compartment  becomes very cold in Summer when AC is in use and warm in winter when heating is in use


It is hard to pull down the sun visor
1 inch scratch on door handle. Noticed this a couple days after taking delivery
Paint is scuffed, as if rubbed by something abrasive. Not as glossy as all other metallic paint
: Sometimes when applying gas, there is more than the usual amount of vibration, which is felt in the steering wheel and the foot pedals.
Just difficult to reach
Manually lifting the trunk hatch is difficult, it's  hard and slow
I just noticed the dust on the rims of the wheels.  I don't know how much of it is dust mixed with dirt
The steering wheel does heat up fairly quickly but never to a very warm temp and not the entire wheel
The headrest control is somewhat difficult to use, it might be the positioning
The belt fits closely against the seat and is difficult to reach
The cup holder seems to be too close to the dashboard
This is not an ongoing problem, just occurs randomly
Cannot lock car w/o using the remote each time or to open/ unlock either
: occasionally, but only on limited occasions the bluetooth disconnects from my iphone.
Difficult to initiall figure out how to open it
Just not clear

Having to click on the one button before you click on set is really inconvenient and seems unnecessary once you figure it out...had to watch the video twice it works.
This is a great feature that is so hard to figure out so then it takes too long to actually use in the city when you must get into position and back up quickly.
Radio cuts out ofte. Also volume between AM then Sattelite radio is so varied one screams then you cannot hear the other
Voice often does not recognize name given. Names that are in my phone and call often
Live in old area of Pennsylvania and it cannot find many local places
I am short. When the seat is up where I can see over the steering wheel it is difficult to find and connect the seat belt into the buckle
This just started. Really annoying


seems to occasionally drop blue tooth.   maybe 3 times in the 10 weeks I have had the car.  not taken to dealer as it is not happening often enough
just after delivery we noticed a black scuff mark on the rear seat...likely caused by the rep who delivered the vehicle
: Just a recommendation: the central locking system was originally hard to find. It may be better located on the driver√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s door or by the gearshift.
Apple CarPlay unable/way too slow to process requests. Dealer said its typical and blamed it on Apple and disabled CarPlay. But it cost me $400 as an option that I can't use!
detected the bubble 2 months and 1 day after delivery. Dealership did not have a replacement and the tire mfg wanted to see and analyze it before I could get a new replacement. I wound up paying 1/2 the price of a new tire plus balancing, et al. Had to wait 1 week for the tire to be replaced. I had to store it in my garage for that week because they could not schedule the work done till a later date. I have still not heard from the dealership if the mfg determined if the tire was defective or something else. If BMW is going to place expensive tires on their cars then they should have them in stock and be able to determine if a new car warranty is worth something. It has been 3 weeks and the dealership has not informed me of any decision made by BMW or the mfg concerning whether this was a defective tire or not. Disappointing!
On 2 occasions the display just did not appear and I could not see it .
sometimes it just does not fully connect

Not sure how to use this function therefore I rarely use it
Driver seat has been memorized many times. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Never know each time you get into the car.
Have set the driver's preferences several time for the seat and mirror and sometimes it does not work and must be reset. This is maddening
: The new vehicle, in contrast to the replaced same model vehicle, does not allow to mobile phones to work simultaneously through Bluetooth.  Also, the navigation system is not set up for the most practical route and to avoid 1 minute of time will instead direct a route of two tolls rather than one. This is acceptable in areas that the driver knows since the 2nd toll route can be avoided, but not so in unfamiliar areas.  This is not a dealer issue - manufacturer responsibility.

The AC is hot when car starts in the morning.  I have to blast it for awhile then it gets cool.




: Rotors are always rusted??
Rear wiper only covers a portion of the rear windshield, leaving the rest of the windshield dirty most of the time.
Display is hard to see when wearing polarized sunglasses.  Workaround solution is to turn up brightness of display to max, which works sufficiently during daytime conditions, but leaves display quite bright at night.
That you need to hold down self-parking button for entire process defeats the purpose of self-parking; also, self-parking only works well when vehicle senses it is very close to a parking spot, even if the driver sees a spot that might be a bit further away.
Apparently due to gas cap issues, but seems to go away on it's owmn.  Annoying.
Check engine light came on one time took to dealer the light went off on it's own in the service Lane and I went home , has not come on since .
the trunk often opens overbite in the garage.

nav doesn't seem to respond to voice commands at all - could be user error - maybe another session with the wizards.
car doesn't recognize the keys between my husband and myself. Doesn't move at all when a different key is used.
The noise is coming from the front of the car. Not sure if its wind, tires, brakes or suspension. Just a constantly annoying noise while driving
The noise seems to be coming from the front right of the car. Bearing? Brakes? Suspension? BMW said it was road noise from the tires. If this is the case, this is the noisiest BMW X3 I have ever driven. My prior X3 did not have this problem. I test drove another X3 before I ordered mine and it did not have this problem even though it had the same run flat tires on the car.
To open locked door you must grab handle and pull.  To lock door must use your thumb on hanldle.  This function would work after delivery.  BMW dealer fixed by installing a new module.  No problems noe.
The control is close to the gear shift where hand and or harm can easily turn it off.
The rear view mirrors are stained. I have an appointment next week to have dealer assess the problem. Mirrors wont clean up. There seems to be a permanent blemish I cant get off.
A length of tube was leaking refrigerant, had to be ordered from Europe.  Was just repaired on 2/15/2018.

Lumbar support didn't work when sitting in the seat. Would work when not sitting in seat. Dealer replaced the seat module and problem fixed. : Needed a new battery and seat module
Car would start but a 'replace battery' warning would be displayed on dashboard. : Needed a new battery and seat module


Not used to the size of the breaks, car stops quickly and straight but some noise that i have never experienced
Hard to find
Difficult to find the mileage reset once you refill the gas tank
the self locking on the driver door doesn't always work
When playing music stored on iPHONE, selection of music is not paired properly. If seek to play certain song, system plays another different song.
On cold or hot evenings, usually windows fog or have excessive condensation. Use defroster or air conditioner along with wiping windows down to get clearer view.
constant bump when driving.

: Trunk hatch randomly closes on its own, and does not recognize if people or objects are in its way : Sometimes the trunk randomly closes on its own, causing injury.
If you lightly touch the sides of the door or console, it easily scuffs : The console has dirty upon the delivery, and it is very difficult to keep it clean
The car smells like cigarettes, and after months the smell hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t abated
phone contacts only show from A to M.
When I have my hands full with things to put in the trunk and I open thrunk with key fob, it does not pop open but I still have to put my fingers under the hood and pull and it's always hard to open.
Sometimes the address I program in comes up as other address choices.
I have approximately 3,000 miles on the car.  The rough idle doesn't occur all the time - sometimes it is after cold start, then is fine and sometimes it occurs on restart when the car isn't completely cold.  I haven't brought the car in for service yet - but intend on doing so ASAP.
Frameless doors lead to very high wind noise at highway speeds - conversely, cabin is well insulated at 'normal' driving speeds under 75mph
M Performance breaks  display significant brake dust
Calendar skips a day every once in a while so that the date continues to be wrong

Trouble getting It to understand my commands
: Engine sign and Battery sign came on on two separate occasion. It took two days for the dealership to repair something to do with engine sign. And took 6 days to repair battery sign defect as they had to order a part for it.

The engine light came on twice after 5 weeks of leasing the car.  They found fault for DSC flex ray communication. The test plan was inconclusive, they cleared the fault. I took my car home.  Two days later the engine light came on again.   They ran more tests and found a faulty DSC.  They had to order parts from Germany and it took 7 - 10 days.
Controls are very minimum. Can't do much except change air flow


It works, however it is very slow.

some sort of residue around the shark fin antenna on the roof. Almost a perfect circle around the Fin.

Sirius XM consistently interrupted reception. Unresolved. FM/AM and all other radio reception excellent and no issues.
: There was a cut in the middle backseat headrest.
: Sometimes when reversing after first starting the car in the morning, the brakes will squeal.  Not that big of deal, as it goes away quickly.
: I was surprised to find that the car only had a USB auxiliary port and not also a 3.5 mini jack.  I had wanted to play music from my smartphone using its DAC and frequency controls through a 3.5 mini jack connection but could not.  Also in general, the harman kardon premium stereo I think is not quite as nice sounding as the harman kardon I had in my 2008 335i.

The front edge of the bottom seat cushion seems angled too high and as a result, it cuts off circulation to my legs, especially my left leg.  I've tilted the seat as far forward as possible, but the edge still applies pressure under my leg .  Every so often I have to bend my leg up to get circulation back or drive with the my leg constantly bent up.
The cargo net in the trunk, when attached, is not easy to use.  The trunk floor to which it is attached is not anchored, so when I left the net to try to get something underneath, the entire trunk floor lifts up.  So I have to unhook the net to get something underneath and then reattach it, which is a bit inconvenient.  In addition, one of the attachment hooks got stuck in its receptacle and when I tried to undo it, a piece of the receptacle broke off.  The hook still works, but it can no longer 'lock' in.
Left side needs extra push to latch.
Hard to see, especially in the dark, which button is one and which is two.
You have to tip a travel cup to insert or remove it from the holder behind the gear selector.
Going through a car wash, water sometimes drips in at the front left and right corners where the convertible roof meets the windsheild frame. Appears the water pressure is enough to penetrate at those spots. Had the same problem with a 2011 3 series convertible used to own. Solution was to find a car wash with less pressure.
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what the system does or doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t is it just a video or does it have alerts and guides?
There is no rear windshield wiper, and there really needs to be one!
The headlight washer sprays the top, sides of the car, and the back windshield.  I wish I could turn this feature off.

Fan simply is noisy.
Always looks cloudy even when I throughly clean the windshield multiple time
I do not know how it happens, but, my radio station goes from sxm to Pandora without me intentionally doing it.I suspect it is something on the steering wheel that I unintentionally touch, but I am not sure
: radio switches from sxm to Pandora, not sure why or what I inadvertently touch
Display can't be seen with polarized sunglasses EVEN if head-up display rotation control is implemented.
: Major MEDIA  problem: the Playlists shown on the vehicle's touch screen are near useless in that they do not correlate with the lists on my iPhone and it is impossible to accurately select an album  - poor correlation with my iPhone's headings; the MEDIA system frequently drops my selection during first moments of play, reverting to stubbornly play another entry on my iPhone's Playlist or Artists - VERY irritating; the MEDIA system reacts very slowly to downloading my iPhone's music entries so as to get started; this was not the case with my previous BMW's

I was driving and the check engine light came on.  I got home parked the car, restarted the car it was still on.  Waited until the next morning the light came on and add i began to drive it went off.  Called the dealership and scheduled a service call.

Squeaking noise in the suspension on any up or down movement of vehicle


Pano roof trim was sticking up.
when trying to play music from iPhone the media does not show. I have to delete and re-pair the devices.
When using phone voice commands, software does not account for this and there is very loud feedback over the speakers.  Phone is android OS
Most new vehicles today don't have a gas cap. Much cleaner and easier to use than cars with gas caps you have to remove by hand.
Steering wheel does not tilt low enough. You have to raise the seat on order to feel comfortable. We test drove a vehicle with manual tilt and it was fine.
key is in coat pocket, I attempt to use foot to open hatch bc my hands are full of bags and hatch will not recognize key or open.  I have to physically get my key out of my pocket and hit unlock and then it opens. This just started happening  so I will see if it persists and then take issue to dealer if necessary. : back hatch is currently not recognizing my key's presence  at times and will not open w the foot activation - this is sporadic so I haven't taken it to the dealer yetback hatch would not open/shut when prompted once 
the defrost diagram line seems to be too low on the display - therefore, I always think I'm selecting the upper vents when I'm really selecting the defrost
'thought' I had a glass of soda secured n my front cup holder - turned a corner and glass fell over to the side of the holder and spilled soda everywhere - why must I jam my glass into the holder in order for it to be secured properly?
: the carpet feels thin/cheap and holds pet hair, human hair and lint - difficult to vacuumalso, the space between the seats and the door area  is so narrow that I can't fit my vacuum attachment between it so it looks dirty all of the time
this is about GLOVE BOX/compartment: box will not close with the owner manual lying on the bottom of box.  If try to close box with manuals in the box, lid comes off its hinges.Must carefully tilt manuals to vertical and then carefully close glove box.  just stupid design of one or other or both.
glove compartment will not close with manuals lying in the glove compartment


Sounds like plastic rubbing plastic. Hear it more on a rough pavement. Started when weather turned cold.
Could be same noise I said from steering wheel
It is just confusing how to car the car off.  Obviously I know to take cook off of break and push the engine off button, but if you open the door first, while in park) it turns the engine off but not the electronics.  Sometimes I will come back to garage and lights, etc and still on 30 minutes later.  I am sure that it works the way it is supposed to, but I find it confusion.
: The Universal Remote garage door opener mounted on the rear view mirror sometimes does not work to close the garage door.
Connection issues with Pandora
Sliding door can come out of alignment.  Can fix by myself when it happens.
cover plate for the front tow point came loose/fell off but was contained by the wire. Dealer replaced; fine now.

Pax front seat sensor broke
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s easy to engage accidentally due to the location
The passenger seat is no where near as warm as driver seat. Dealership checked and claimed it is the same temp, but you can definitely tell a difference
: The knob for the map/communication is in the way of your arm.  It gets knocked to easily.  The placement on the 128i was much better.
Need a bit more space to pull the container out.  Have to tilt to extract drink.
I have taken my vehicle to the service department and a part has been ordered for the noise.  Apparently, a there was a certain part that was not properly placed causing my car to sound like a Fast & Furious race car when starting

It is unclear to me how to synchronize the dual temperature control.
Occasionally it is difficult to engage 1st gear, particularly at a stop light. Seems to be worse with a cold car. No grinding noises.
I have no idea how to make this system work.
Not so much difficult to use but I can't figure out exactly how to get the Auto temp to work. Sometimes I have AC 'off' and it's low 60s outside and thermostat set at 69 and it's too hot but still hot air is coming out of the vents. Even when center vent temp rotating dial is set to blue color. How am I supposed to use the Auto and the rotating red/blue dial? It's unclear to me.
See answer above. I'd like for Auto to just take care of the temp but it doesn't seem to work that well. Similar to my previous 4 series BMW.
It appears that wheels are dirty on the inside even though I have less than 2,000 miles on the X1.
There was a storm. Might have been the cause.
Vents just not strong enough air flow.
The rear seat AC is very weak, and only works if front seat AC is on highest setting. In California, AC is a necessity.Also, the front seat left side vent is very weak.
The items slide around in the cargo section, despite  trying a cargo net. Hard to attach bungee cords to keep bags in place securely.

Bluetooth doesn't stay connected at all times.  Always need to reestablish bluetooth when streaming music. : bluetooth doesn't stay connected when streaming music.
The velcro on the floor comes off when the floor mat is taken off.
There were stains in the black color  painted part on the underside of the liftgate spoiler. This was caused by the installation of the white plastic sheet that BMW installs on the vehicle at the end of the production line. Only cure was a new part for the spoiler. Unfortunately, it took about 2.5 months for BMW to get the part from Germany. Seems kind of stupid that the BMW X3 is only produced in the USA and that the part itself is made in the USA, then shipped to Germany for parts stock, only to have to be shipped back to the USA. I understand there are currently over 900 X3's in the USA alone, not including overseas markets that are waiting for the same part due to the same problem that affected early production X3's. Since they were alerted to the problem by my dealership, they have revised the white plastic sheet so it doesn't overlap onto the black plastic part of spoiler.
When first sitting into drivers seat, the seat back has some play in it. Does it everytime I get into the seat. Dealer tech said he also noticed it, yet he doesn't have a fix. I tried another X3 on the dealers lot with the same seat, and it also does the same thing. Annoys me everytime.
: HVAC system doesn't always remember the last setting when engine was turned off. Even though I always completely turn off the HVAC system before turning off the engine and exiting the vehicle for the day, once in a while, upon restart the next day, the HVAC will turn on by itself at 72 degrees. I then have to turn it off again. Annoying.
Passenger front door window has many small scratches in glass about 2' in length near bottom of window.
The mirror has a manufacturing issue - it shows double images.
the wood paneling around A/C outlets is mis-aligned.
Armrest started to bubble and seperate. Leather delaminated from the armrest.
you can not see the display if you use a rayban or similar sunglass. I live in Florida, so I need to wear sunglasses so the head-up display becomes useless. The dealer already alerted me that this was going to happen.
The Head-Up Display can not be seen with a sunglass which is the most common situation.
: can't see heads up display with sunglasses on : can not see heads up display with sun glasses on
not sure how to use this feature
There is less space then the 535 In the center console, so it's not enough space  and on the door I had a little small storage to hold small items by the handle . ju
The location is difficult to open from the driver's seat as you have to reach far back to have the lid clear in order to reach in to find anything.  Also, there is not a lot of space to put things in, and there really is not a good place to put spare change unlike other BMW's I have owned.
The metallic storage area cover (a cool looking metallic pattern, has been scratched and scuffed form normal wear.
It will pair when I first get in the car but not pair after despite repeated attempts.
In two instances it did not provide a clear route between two two major highways, instead providing a wandering route that I eventually abandoned. Another time it did not distinguish between s business and a street of the same name. The route on the screen sometimes extends beyond the raster. The orientation on the screen sometimes seems inverted.
TIRE DEFLATES IN CHANGE OF WEATHER
The locking pin in the front axle had not been put in.
I do not know how to work the voice recognition system and it is cumbersome.
Date sometimes skips a day or 2, has to be manually be changed to correct date.

 : Way too much road noise above 45 mph.
Brake pedal is too far from the floor.
You cannot see the controls ...
Not working upon delivery, replaced sensors and is working now.
Backup Camera was working intermittently.  As were other electronic functions.
Does not recognize road closures/construction.

Satellite radio keeps cutting in and out on all channels.  I've contacted Sirius XM to ping my radio but it still doesn't help.  Plan on going to dealer to see if it's a radio problem.
Smell is a cross between smoke and new car smell.  I'd prefer new car smell without the smoke smell.  At delivery, Dealer said nothing could be done and that it was normal.
: Warning of 'chassis malfunction'.  Dealer had car for 2-3 days to determine with BMW how to correct.  Ended up resetting software for entire car.  No problems since and it's been 2 weeks.
You cannot close the cover of the cup holder where the USB port is located.  It should be in the armrest where the phone could be plugged in and the lid closed - similar to my past X5.
After I wash my car, excessive water holds in the side mirror cracks and when I take off the wind blows the water out , streaking my car.
: Brake makes noises when i start off , it feels like it it clutching to the brake, I hear it once and it goes away, then i hear it again
I feel as if the brake pedal is to close to the gas pedal and if one is not careful might hit the brake instead of gas or vice versa

After the 3rd day; I returned the vehicle to the dealer
The steering froze, it was hard to turn

Names are frequently misinterpreted when trying to make a phone call or indicate an address : The same misinterpretation of names and addresses seems inherent to all navigation systems.  I had the same problem with my 2014 X5.
The display is small and there is not option to change the display to an easier one to see at a glance.  We find that we have to hunt for the time
I have only used it a couple of times but I feel like I have to hunt for the horn. I press all over the steering wheel until I find the horn
I ABSOLUTELY HATE the automatic shut off on the ignition!  You should have the option to turn that off to stay off, as it is I have to remember to turn it off everytime I start the vehicle.  This can not be good on the engine to keep shutting off and starting
The lane departure system is on ALL THE TIME in my vehicle.  The slightest veer left of right - or even changing lanes makes it turn on.  When I have time I will find out how to turn off this feature
The space between the passenger seat and the console makes it easy to drop things under the passenger seat but also difficult to retrieve. Speciafically, BMW sent me a lovely USB device but while trying to install it, it slipped out of my hands and fell between the passenger seat and the console. I may have to bring the car in so that someone can get it from underneath the seat. So, far it hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t compromised the gears or components that are under the seat.
CarPlay disconnects unexpectedly.  Unreliable connection.
: CarPlay and mobile phone connectivity is very unreliable.
1. The iPhone will cycle between the bluetooth connection and the handeset.  Frequency is about 1.5-2 seconds. This is an intermittent problem.2. When using Apple Car Play an app  will have audible guidance and after it is finished the system will turn on media in the phone.  The driver has to manually change the system back to radio.3. There are some apps that do not run with Apple Car Play.  Glympse, stops use of the phone to allow use on the touch screen, but the touch screen doesn't allow use of Glympse.
2. When using Apple Car Play an app  will have audible guidance and after it is finished the system will turn on media in the phone.  The driver has to manually change the system back to radio.

My iPhone would pair but the system would not be able to move through songs or move with voice commands.

what more is there to say?  If the name 'Edward' is spoken, and the response is 'Do you mean Mark?' is the response...
Apple Car Play and BMW built in systems work in parallel universes.  Very disconcerting, and almost impossible to get into/ out of one into the other.  Once in Car Play, which is superior for making tele calls, the navigation system defaults to a smaller screen, Google based map.  The BMW nav system is larger, easier to read, has superior graphics, and retains locations for future use, but the Google system is more intuitive in terms of finding a new location quickly.  Music played using Car Play seems to be at a lower quality, less volume and stereo separation, etc, than through the BMW system; switching between the two can, as a result, cause considerable problems.  I have not taken to the dealer since I have been told it is not a BMW created problem, which is the same thing that I've been told in the past with iPhone interfaces, especially when iOS is updated.
Difficult to understand
: the driver side arm rest is wrapped in leather or faux leather, where the arm actually rests on it on the flat top part the leather has a permanent crease line that runs through it. its small, but it shouldnt be there, almost looks like they permanently creased or scratched the leather. the armrest shows the long but narrow crease down the whole length. this is not found on other doors. its very small and not very noticeable, but it is definitely an issue with quality.



very difficult to take off

cup holder not large enough
: When connected to my iPhone, the music information will not update. If it does, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the wrong information. Haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t taken it to the dealership since I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been gone for work.
The seat belts next to the doors is hard to locate when seated.
: This is not a big problem but an annoyance - in the Cargo area, when you pull the cover over - it has left scratch marks on the sides even though I am careful. the marks seam to show up even more with the black interior than they did with the tan interior on my earlier model.
Plastic cover at end of seat backward and forward rail on passenger side broke off.
I think the minor chips occurred during the car delivery to the dealer, or during preparation.  There were two very small chips at the right rear wheel well, and were touched up before the car was delivered to me.  Later I saw evidence of some buffing in that area, and while looking carefully, one can see the small area where the paint was buffed.
Controls not clear
had to keep adding air in the rear tires to finally stop the low tire warning from popping up each time I started the car.  It should have been at the right psi from the dealer.  Probably not the cars fault, but it was like it didn't register the air I kept adding until much later on....
: I find navigating around the radio and other features almost impossible to understand.  Nothing seems to be intuitive and reading the manual doesn't seem to help.  The operators manual always refers to the Navigation, Entertainment and Communication manual, but there was none.  Dealer didn't know of any either.  Had to go to BMW of north America to get an answer - its a web download.  You would think the dealer would know that.
Sometimes it recognizes the driver correctly and adjusts the seat and sometimes it recognizes the passenger as the driver.  We have two separate key fobs, it gets them mixed up.
The connectivity with apple card play fails all the time
The motion sensor to easily open the hatch with your foot rarely seems to work. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s difficult to pickup the sensor and I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t use this feature any longer.

Noisy at low speeds
Dealer said new battery can get depleted when cold weather persists.

Dealer says it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s becauce it is a convertible. All that is needed is more powerful lifters for the heavier truck lid
The automatic open hatch function doesn't work properly, sometimes you have to stay longer and wait for the trunk to be open which is not efficient and practical.

When put the rear gear, occasionally the camera doesn't work, can't see anything on the display screen for the rear view. After turning off the car for 20 min, then restart, the camera works. This happens once in a while, every 2 weeks.

It's hard to simply pause and stop the music .
Bottom part of seat is too tight. Constrains my left leg when I try to place my foot on the footrest.
Shifting is wrong when engine is cold. Also, car goes to neutral at times when moving slowly .
When the car reaches 40 mph or above, the lane departure warning will come on even though the car is within the lanes.  As soon as the car slows down to 40 mph or below, the warning light would turn off.  This happens every single time.
Sometimes there are a lot of statics.
Noise is too loud and goes off for too long..... makes revsersing an extremely unpleasant experience.  I would LOVE to be able to turn the sound off.
Can't find them
seats are uncomfortable.  Bang head on the door when entering the car.  poor design.
Seat adjustment does not provide adequate range of settings., and seat juts forward at an uncomfortable angle, and cannot be adjusted.
not sure how to operate
angle of seat is uncomfortable
Didn't notice it for two weeks later.  Bought it and left for Hawaii the next day on vacation.  Came home and gave it the once over and noticeda very small scratch on the rear rim.  Wish I would of bought the wheel protection plan.
Shoes easily scuffed the bottom door sills. The metal that has the 'M' insignia gets scratched
The passenger rear tail light doesn't work whencar is in parking light mode.
When car is unlocked not all doors unlock. Even if remote is pressed twice. Very annoying.
Radio reception fades in and out. Also a lot of static. Even for stations we know have strong signals.
Will select memory button for station. Next time in car radio doesn't remember station. Sometimes radio control will skip over station i want to hear. I then have to back out of entire radio settings. Find the manual radio settings. Then enter the radio station. There are many steps for this and its confusing to use.
Very difficult to understand and use controls for radio. Still do not know where bass and treble control are.
The horn needs to be pressed very hard to get it to sound.  Should be easier.
NO daytime backlighting for the gauges noted above.  Analog speedometer really difficult to read 70% of the time in daylight driving conditions.
Door panels scuff easily if shoes rub against them when entering or exiting the car.
The rattle is intermittent, and seems to have disappeared again.
Sometimes the car is sluggish after a complete stop 


I have to pair the phone almost every time I get into the car

The cup holders are not big enough to hold certain water bottles or mugs
have trouble w btooth & apple car play   Car play is difficult to use and limites functionality while driving, e.g., pushing a number when connected to automated response unit w/ dialing options
All Lights on left side of vehicle stopped working occasionally upon start up.
All lights on left side of vehicle stopped working occasionally upon starting.


swriling marks on hood and trunk. like car was buffed out with a rough material

The clock is consistently 19 seconds fast, despite having enabled the control to automatically update the clock.
The 'automatic' windshield wipers seems random, not automatic.  sometimes you have tu move up or down to get the wipers to stop, but it is random.
You should be able to just hit set and resume.  You shouldn't have to turn it on first and have to take your eye off the road to find that button.  More importantly, when driving in slush, if the sensors become covered, the adaptive cruise control suddenly disables itself and slams on the brakes to get you back to the speed limit.  There is no manual override to use conventional cruise control.
It warns of lane departure when it sees tar or other patterns on the road that are not lane indicators.
Frequently, but not always, I will try to make a hands-free call, but the system will tell me I need to pair my device .
: If I try to use navigational guidance to go somewhere, the system will try to take me to that same location each and every time I start driving somewhere -- even after I have been to the original location.  If I delete the address from my iPhone app, the issue goes away, but I shouldn't have to d that every time I drive.
The seat is not always in the same position -- and I am the only driver.  I told  my BMW Genius, and I think it is working now.
There are far too many controls to adjust to maintain a consistent temperature.  I just want to set a temperature and have everything adjust to that temperature.  I shouldn't have to dial one thing up, close another vent, change where the air is flowing from, etc.

I would NOT consider the road noise to be 'excessive', but my husband and I were surprised that it was noticeable on the highway at higher speeds.  I did follow-up with the BMW dealer and was told that it could be because of the larger/heavy duty tires , but the noise seems to be coming from the front side windows.
Won't fully latch unless you slam it 'just right'.
Rear flew open while driving, numerous times. Fixed by dealer changing how  doors locks. Also sometimes doesn't open fully but stops midway

Now fixed but all sounds in car went out. Part had to be ordered from germany. Took forever.
When high enough, uf you push seat back tge heuggt lowers. Last x3 same thing
Middle headrest blocks rearview mirror,  cant move
THE SIGNAL GETS LOST OFTEN  AND NOTHING PLAYS. SATELLITE CHANNELS SAY THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE.
: CHECK ENGINE LIGHT REPEATEDLY COMES ON AND CAR SMELLS LIKE SOMETHING IS BURNING
Took for repair, but bmw would not allow dealer to replace headlight until they removed head light and dryed.  Will only replace if condensation occurs again.  Condensation returned within one week
: Entertainment/Navigation system wouldn't load sometimes after startup.
Entertainment/Navigation system wouldn't load sometimes after startup.
Audio/Navigation system wouldn't load sometimes after startup.
Wouldn't load properly sometimes and would occasionally have the wrong vehicle location. : Entertainment/Navigation system had to be updated after purchase.
This feature has been on previous BMWs but I was able to disable it and have the key fob remember my setting of disable. This dealer is unable to program this vehicle to do that  so I have to press the disable button every time I start the engine. I think this automatic engine shut down/restart feature is awful. I do not believe it saves on fuel and do believe it creates more wear on the engine and starter.
Warning light should be much larger and relocated away from the mirrors where they are almost impossible to see with car headlights reflected in the mirror
I think the speed settings are off.
There are a couple of times when I have tried to back out of a spot that the backup camera does not turn on at all. It has happened about 4 times.
When you are at a stop light the engine cuts off...that part is fine, but it seems like it takes too long....like it is starting up from scratch, not just 'Resting'. : just the hybrid style engine taking too long to kick back on.

Window  and Road noise   I mentioned to sales person.  It's probably due to it being a Sport Model, instead of regular sedan vehicle.
: Outside noise from window, tires.  Glove compartment doesn't close correctly, unless book manual is placed on lip.  Won't close otherwise!!  Was told that this is the design, no replacement.
My daughters Hyundai Sonata USB port is located in an easy, and accessible location. Right below center console.
Even with the 'Fan' almost to max, hardly any air blows out!  It takes awhile to heat up!  Again, our Buick Lacrosse has a much better heating system. : The heat takes awhile to regulate.  The Buick Lacrosse has a better climate control, and heats 'a lot faster.'
: Outside noise from window, tires.  Glove compartment doesn't close correctly, unless book manual is placed on lip.  Won't close otherwise!!  Was told that this is the design, no replacement.
STRONG ODOR SIMILAR TO PERSPIRATION, IT MAY BE THE TYPE OF LEATHER USED.
OFF WHITE LEATHER SOILS EASILY BY NATURE
SMELLS LIKE EXHAUST OR CHEMICALS THAT ARE USED TO TAN LEATHER 
automatic foot activated hood release hard to operate.
Nav system doesn't find my home address! Rarely gets any address first time. Difficult to make a hands free call if it doesn't have number in memory.
doesn't appear to change angle significantly

tilt adjustment doesn't appear to change angle of seat significantly
The cruise speed stops displaying after a while; would like to see the MPH at all times.
: Callers say they cannot hear me when I use the hands-free phone.Re: navigation system, it does not speak the first direction of a route.  I have to look at my dash to know what to do.
: Callers say they cannot hear me when I use the hands-free phone.Re: navigation system, it does not speak the first direction of a route.  I have to look at my dash to know what to do.
A large cup will hit the console--not enough clearance.
: Once, right after I started the car up, the airbag light stayed on  I put the car in drive to get it out of the garage, and the airbag light went out. It has never stayed on since that one and only time.
The USB port is in the center console storage between the seats, it should have been by the radio
being a short person, I have the drivers seat up pretty far, so I have a very long reach with my left arm to reach back and get the seat belt. With the door open it's not too bad but becomes much more difficult if the door is shut


Uturn situation. Intermittent. From rear wheel area.


It is complex and inconsistent in putting in address and then finding it later.  My last car was very simple

About a week in I noticed the squeaking noise.  It was loud! I waited a few weeks to see if it would go away.  Finally called the dealer.  They put me at ease, set up an appointment and fixed it right the first time.  I was very impressed with the service and the people I dealt with. Almost glad I had that experience because now I know firsthand if I ever have an issue, they will be there for me, hassle-free. : Brakes sqeaked when braking.  I delayed a few weeks to see if it would go away on its own.  Finally brought it in and they took great care of me and the issue was resolved.
dealer said wait a few months let doors settle in
front passenger door hard to shut and concern not aligned so wind comes in
The system didn't work at all. An error message appeared on the screen every time I started the car. I had to eliminate the warning to use the sreen at all. I returned the car to the dealer to have it repaired. Required a reprogramming of the car's control computer. Repaired now. A quick fix was attempted, but it didn't work.
Bluetooth often disconnects/loses connectivity with iPhone.  When multiple phones are present switches inadvertently to secondary phone or when trying to pair for audio playback, has difficulty maintaining connection
Doesn't fit the manual
: There are different user settings with the vehicle. Sometimes it doesn't know the difference between the users. Like my husband will get in with his key & it will be on my setting. Then when i go to get in with my key it will think it's my husband getting in. Gets annoying for us both.
My problem with the heads up display is that i wear polarized oakley sunglasses during the day. Even on the daylight i struggle to see the heads up display even on the brightest setting. So i have to constantly lift up my sunglasses to see what speed i am going. I would have preferred a digital speedometer somewhere on the screen. I am not a big fan of the heads up display. I like everything to be on the dashboard screen behind the steering wheel.
I hear wind noise coming from the back windows.


Discoloration when to touch or rub it
There is no indicator on the dashboard about the heated steering wheel, which means when you turn the heater on, there is no icon or symbol indicating that your steering wheel heater is on. There is a little message that flashes for a second when you turn it on, but then it disappears. That's not the case for every other comfort feature -- when your heated seats are on, there's a 3-light indicator telling you A) they're on, and B) the level of heat.  With the steering wheel heater, there's nothing.
For some reason the system refuses to save preset radio stations, so you're forced to 'scan' all stations to find one you want, which is time-consuming and ANNOYING.
1) The Nav system doesn't allow you to keep the map zoomed out, which I prefer. You don't always want to see a dot  moving down a street, you want to see it from a distanced aerial view for greater perspective.2) I don't enjoy the woman's voice who speaks the Nav directions. There should be options like in GoogleMaps where you can choose male or female, and accent, such as American english or British english.
There were scratches and blemishes at delivery on the marked locations. Some were detailed and buffed but they still remain.

Page 6 of the owners manual says to contact your dealer for a written book explaining the workings of the nav system and the i-connect system. I have talked with my dealer 4X since my November purchase, talked to the local BMW Genius,and called BMW's 800# 4 times to find out about getting the desired written instructions. All contacts tell me that the book or instructions have not been written yet!!!!! They didn't seem to mind me writing the check for the full amount of the car but they didnt' do their writing yet! Yeash!!!!!!

I think the rubber in the window seals are rubbing against something causing the creaks
Clutch pedal squeaks on initial depression when ambient temperature is warm
Faint whine from transmission on light throttle at cruising speedsClutch chatters at low speed 1st to 2nd gear changesOccasionally 1st gear engagement is rough and rattlesShort grinding noise when going up steep driveway at an angle, when one wheel comes off the ground momentarilySoft clunk when fully engaging reverse gear

Sometimes the tailgate will not lift open when latch is pulled.
The main computer went completely out. It was replaced and now periodically there are glitches such as warning lights come on with no problem, voice recognition won't work,.

The phone disconnects from the Bluetooth
It will tell us there is debris in the road, road hazards, car fire road impassable and nothing is there
Can not tell they are even working
Spotify and Pandora don't always connect.
It started happening 2-3 months after I received the vehicle. Worked fine in the beginning.
When I got the car it rode like it did not have any suspension system.  It rode like a truck.  The problem was the dealer had not removed the transportation 'stops' placed before shipment from Germany. Once the 'stops' were removed the car was back to normal.
Car brakes smoothly and quickly but they groan on moderate to heavy braking
When I first come to the garage and open the car, a series of noises occur.  I am use to hearing the initial noises.  I am hearing one new noise.  More of a squeak.  Not what I normally have heard in my previous cars.
I hear the squeaking at random.  And I had intentionally NOT gotten a car with the M brakes this time, because the squeaking was so bad.
: The computer shuts down and restarts at random.  Loss of connectivity with iphone.  Music tracks restart at random.  Music tracks default to a different song than is shown on the iphone.  Steering controls not initiating change to computer.
This often occurs if I don't hold the phone in my hand.  Kinda defeats the purpose of bluetooth. : The computer shuts down and restarts at random.  Loss of connectivity with iphone.  Music tracks restart at random.  Music tracks default to a different song than is shown on the iphone.  Steering controls not initiating change to computer.
Guests in rear seat have complained that the volume of cool air coming from the vent in inadequate.

The lumber support does not stay in memory.

The chrome molding on the driver's side door is slightly loose.
see earlier response - the car is at the dealer fr the 3rd time for the check engine problem. They still have the car. : Check engine light comes on. Sometimes it goes away on it's own. I've taken the car to the dealer 3 times, it is now at the dealer for the 3rd time with the same problem in 2 months. The car has less than 700 miles on it. The last two times they reset an error code and test drove the car and gave it back to me. I told them this time to keep it until it's fixed.
I have had sporadic readings and Im not sure if there is a problem with the tire pressure or not because the notice does not come up consistently ???
Does not blow from the center console effectively
Is does not get the dialed up temperature selected, sometimes have to crank it way up or down to get the heat or cool to work
I have asked the dealer to set the Driver heated seat warmer but they say it cant be done,This is very disappointing to me !!!!!!!!!!!!!
I added the M performance brake option and the wheels get very dirty and require cleaning every 2-3 days.  My other BMW does not have the M performance brakes, and the brake dust is not an issue at all.



: Looses Blue Tooth connection
It covers the bottom of the gas pedal, have to adjust every time



: Gauge Display and I-Drive Display Screen difficult to see, due to Type of window tint applied to windows by dealer. The darkness inside vehiclewith tinting applied caused sensors inside vehicle to dim the digital guage display and I-Drive display, and made very difficult to see clearly what was on the screens.

Front passenger seat headrest is a little lose and locks in one position. There is also a rattle that seems to be coming from the rear seat, but I have not been able to identify it yet.
The control is in the center of the dash and is hard to reach if you are standing on the outside of the door and have to reach in.  It would be easier to access if it was on the door.
The seal squeaks when the door is open and closes
The passenger headrest won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fully lower so is i the line of sight for the driver
: GPS software is incomplete. doesn't have my appartment complex even though it's been built over 5 years
there was a problem with where the coolant line was leading to tearing of this line. we took it back to the dealer and they were able to fix it in about 2 days and said it has since been found to be a problem in the design they have now corrected
Nine days after purchase of the vehicle, the automatic steering mechanism failed.
: Vehicle will intermittently not charge when plugged in. Both at a Home charger and at a level 2 charging station. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been brought in to the dealer 3 times for this issue.
Creak and rattle comes and goes but it isn't a huge deal. Could be fixed but haven't gone around to do so just yet.
Isn't a huge deal but slightly annoying. I'm pretty certain I can get it fixed but haven't gone around to do so just yet.
No keywords, as it tries to do natural language detection can make it very difficult to figure out the right combination of things to say to get it to do something.  Does a poor job recognizing foreign names  and doesn't have the ability to just spell the name in as backup without using the iDrive controls instead of voice.
Not sure how to use
not sure how to use
Need to get more instruction from dealer
Not sure how to use
often doesnt understand my voice commands
Only happens occasionally
not enough room to put your foot on and use effectively.  they are installed right next to the bottom of the opening of the door.  almost same level so there isn't enough room for you to plant your foot on the running board.
The steering is much to heavy.  It's a work out to drive the car.
They are supposed to be all season tires 19' Bridgestone.  However, with the slightest bit of snow or ice the tires are unusable.  The car is a all wheel drive and is dangerous in snow and ice.
: twice in 5 months the rear hatch has frozen/stalled in opening--it was immediately fixed by hitting the open button a second time.
: On 3 occasions the heads up display has failed to display upon starting a trip. Each time this was fixed by using the settings to move the heads up display or change brightness, any change in setting caused it to reappear.
To close, it takes sufficient force, that I feel I am denting the car.   To open, it takes the same force which again makes me feel like the door will dent.  If I am not paying attention, I may feel like the door has shut, when actually it has not.  I have backed out of my garage with the door open and broken it off!  I pay more attention now.
Mainly, the turn signal is different than any other I've had.  When pushed, it returns back to its original position and its difficult to sense when its been pushed for a turn or just tapped for a lane change.  Just need to get used to it.
Just very BMW-ish.  New to me is the master control knob in the center console.  Just takes time.
First off, the steering wheel obscures the check engine light, which possibly means it goes on more often than I notice.  I called the local BMW service department to schedule an appointment, but the light subsequently went off and I was told to wait to see if it would go on again.  It did subsequently go on, but I have yet to be able to set an appointment due to my schedule and the fact that it does not stay on.

The factory installed trailer hitch blocks the sensor for the rear hatch 'kick' sensor to open the rear hatch with your foot.  The hatch can be manually opened at the hatch.  An engineering issue! : See rear hatch kick sensor blocked by factory installed trailer hitch comment.
Sometimes you walk away from the vehicle with the lights on and radio blaring and just hope that it all shuts down
Frustrating not user-friendly set-up and usage
We have driven Mercedes for years;  theirs are much easier to understand and identify.   Up to now I cannot work out why the BMW monitors come on sometimes and others do not.
Cannot see the display with some sunglasses! Also seems to move around on the windshield.






Located deep in menu system. Should be easier to turn off.
Windshield chips much to easily. Very thin. BMW says its for weight savings. BS! No, its cheap thin glass used as a cost savings measure. Not high quality. The windshield in fact is terrible. Lots of waviness causing distortion.
need to have the passenger seat looked at - some times it does not heat up well
Trunk shuts without warning and without being instructed to.
Sometimes has door doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t open.


Navigation audio from phone does not go through Bluetooth when paired


See earlier comment - hard to get a toot and a much weaker toot than previous BMWs
: The horn does not work well, it takes a lot of pressure to get a toot and the sound itself is weak.  I will get BMW to check it when I take it in for service.
When I washed my car for the first time, I noticed a scrape on the right, rear wheel. I did not notice it at my original receiving of the vehicle. i did not bring it to the attention of the dealer as it wasn't discovered upon initial taking ownership of vehicle.


: Back seat does not recline.
Compared to other similar vehicles I owned.  The X5 is not fuel efficient

Control function hard to figure out

If it is windy outside, you aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t unable to hear the audio inside the car with all that excessive wind noise.
Whenever you wear colored clothing  the color scuffs and soils the seats easily, and I paid for additional protection.
The incident occurred two times. I took it to the dealer, and the dealer indicated that it was a problem that they got a recall about - an ignition switch that they had to replace.


Shoes mark the door panel easily,leaving either white or brown streaks.

THE ENGINE SHUT DOWN BUT DOES NOT SHUT DOWN THE INTERIOR LIGHTS AND RADIO IN THE VEHICLE,  AFTER PRESSING THE OFF BUTTON, YOU HAVE PRESS THE OFF BUTTON ON THE KEY FOBB TO TURN THE CAR COMPLETELY OFF.
Keyless control only opens driver door.  But, when using it on passenger side, it opens all doors.
No room to charge cell phone if using cup holder.
USB is hard to reach in center console. Cell phone charger inconenient. Difficult to use cup holder when charging.
The kick to open feature is not consistent. Sometimes it works immediately other times it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work at all. When it opens sometimes it opens all the way and other times it only opens partially.
Does not work consistently
Occasionally the car searches for my phone, it will play music from the phone but still says it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not paired.
The navigation system does not accurately display / deal with traffic conditions.

Detail is covered in comments above

Local FM stations are very fuzzy, fade in and out.
see prior comment : I was stopped at a traffic light when my rear hatch opened.  I hadn't been anywhere near the button and my keys were tucked inside my purse.
Hard to remember how to program
Bluetooth connectivity gets lost OFTEN.  Calls do not disconnect, just the bluetooth.
my cream colored driver seat is somewhat blue from wearing jeans.  I have no idea what to do about this.
: there is a feature that you stand at the back of vehicle and in the middle, stick the foot and truck automatically open. well,, my previous car don't function well with this feature. this new car still doesn't perform well with this feature
: problem with connecting phone to play music in car. also when phone is plug in, the whole system start flashing back and forth.
The interior cabin noise from the outside is louder than in my previous 5 3 Series
: The airbag light came on stating there was a failure about 6-8 weeks after buying the car new
: 1. The Apple car play feature takes a long time to load and does not give you access to individual songs on the play list when streaming music from phone so I turned off the Apple car play. I would not suggest this feature to anyone considering paying more to get it.2. The phone drops the blue tooth connection intermittently. I have never experienced this with my other car nor the loaner that I had while work was being done to my car while using the same phone.3. The idrive will intermittently change from radio to another media  without me changing it.4. The idrive takes longer to load the play list info than in my previous cars. This is a bit annoying given I have never encountered this with my wife's X3 nor any of my other cars.

The driver's side door did not shut cleanly and had to be adjusted in the first week after delivery
Just feel that tbe lughts could be brighter

More of slight distortion on right
The cover does not slide open. Sometime it does, sometimes it does not.  Very difficult to close when opened

Not clear as to getting air to exit the vents.  Use the primary windshield blowers to heat car.
This is a typical BMW trait. While annoying, it's not unexpected.
: Problems exiting from Apple Car Play to other iDrive functions - you have to do it twice .Speed-sensitive volume is too loud when the car is first turned on.
Problems exiting from Apple Car Play to other iDrive functions - you have to do it twice .Speed-sensitive volume is too loud when the car is first turned on.
: Headrest is too far forward and does not adjust up enough to clear the base of my neck properly. This is a VERY common problem among many new vehicles these days!
You can barely tell the ventilation function is working at all.
There is some kind of intermittent interior rattle - very hard to tell exactly where its coming from.
Bottom of door panel scuffs easy from you feet while getting in/out.
Engine cuts off before the vehicle has completely stopped.
Sometimes when you're coming to a stop the transmission hold a too-high gear - when you hit the gas it's sluggish taking off. It does not always do this. I'm actually somewhat used to the behavior since my dual-clutch auto GTI behaved much the same way. But this is a traditional transmission so it's surprising behavior.

Simply too small

Pandora starts automatically even when other audio functions are in operation
Lots of road noise and a squeak from door
: My phone will call its voice mail when i turn on the car. It is not the car problem, it's BMW software because i know several people have the same problem with their BMW 



It takes more than 2 or 3 tries to get it to work.
: the usb power ports won't fast charge my phone
Turn on wipers
Doors must be pushed hard to stay open. They are heavy and tend to try to close again if not pushed open far.
Display is difficult to see when wearing polarized sunglasses.
A sensor came on stating the seatbelt had an error.
I purchased the wireless phone charger. when we went to put my phone in it didn't fit. I was assured before purchase that all phones fit. when we took the case off it final fit, but it was and continues to be a struggle to get it to fit in properly without feeling like I am breaking something.
front window produces noise as if it was not fully closed
Not exactly clear how this is supposed to work
USB is a very common interface. There is only one USB port in the middle console and it is used for USB media. A couple of USB chargers should be available
The glove box is way too small
I have a small pair of glasses and they barely fit in the console. To get them to fit, they have to be put in a specific way
the carpet shows nearly every mark. Purchased all weather mats, which are much better
Check engine light was on for one week before I took it in for service. Dealership reset the light and it came back on for one day a couple of weeks later. It has not reoccured since
: error regarding chassis displaying on dashboard

: The touch screen seems to at times just start registering touches even though no one is touching the screen.  This results in changing channels or options or deactivating maps, or general chaos.  It is like having a 2 year-old randomly poking things.  After a restart, it is gone.  I have not isolated it yet, but I will.
Can I get the AC to just be off?  I do not need the car to decide the temperature and automatically always activate the AC.  If I declare it off, stay off.  No need to waste running a compressor if it isn't warranted by a degree or two.
: I-drive controls sometimes engage unexpectedly while driving.
difficult to locate seat memory button while seated : difficult to locate seat memory button
insulated coffee mugs do not fit
The front wheels must be cleaned daily or they look like s**t. This is a long-standing problem with BMW cars and with it's excellent engineers, you'd think BMW could come up with a solution..
Cruise control identifies upcoming vehicles too early and reduces speed too much.
Can't see speed when exceeding the posted speed limit  and when wearing sunglasses.
Voice and gesture controls have to be repeated multiple times before working correctly.
Dealer reviewed the issue and found nothing to indicate a problem. Check engine light went away.
Iphone 7 plus disconnects and I have to delete the previous pairing atleast once a week. Car is too espensive for items to not work. I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have time to goto dealer.
Navigation doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bring me directlt to location. Gets me in the area.
Phone and car do not always work correctly
I think that is what is marring the nice spoke wheels.
Sometimes, the route seems not the best direct one. On one occasion, the street was not driveable.
It was hard to move the headrest while pushing in the button.
The light for the engine control came on which could lead to excessive fuel use and convertor damage. It went off within 100 miles before I was to take it to the dealer.

In bright sunlight, small imperfections in the windshield are visible.  Noticeable but not not annoying to me.
clicking noise that i normally never heard
Perhaps because of the run flat tires and lack of sound deadening insulation there is excessive road noise when driving the vehicle about 30 mph and higher.  Quite noisy on freeways from the tires on pavement type of noise.  Wind noise does not seem excessive.  I don't believe there is any way to repair it . . . except to buy another car designed to be quieter.
Given my driving style, I should have bought this car with the M package which offers better brakes.  The brakes on my GranCoupe don't inspire confidence.
This may be a problem due to my need to work with the system more and understand how to do that.  I have spoken with the dealer and did get the system to work at that time but will have to see how over time I am able or not able to use the voice command for nav features.
For a BMW, factory installed mats should be of a higher quality more like their aftermarket mats and should have a BMW label as do the aftermarket mats.  Nothing is 'wrong' with the mats fit or finish, they're just not of a high enough quality.
During routine idling at stop lights, the engine will stumble, recover quickly and then run OK.  This occurs only occasionally and I plan to discuss it with the service manager at the local BMW shop.
: Car Play occasional stops working.

Tried to open TJ  hood and couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t figure out after I popped the lever inside the vehicle.
Not sure how to adjust from dashboard
The dealer was not helpful Re the roof rack and did not want to deal with it, so I bought a Thule
BMW does not have good electronics. My Mercedes is much better.
Brakes sqeal when braking in reverse
It is a smoodge; noticed it on both sides; after I took the car in for a malfunction in the PDC
: The sound system sounds VERY CHEAP; often have to turn up the system because it is so low; base/ is very weak; not suitable for a car of this caliber.  I would have returned the vehicle if I heard the sound during test driving.  My 2010 Audi A4 has a BETTER sound system than this; and that system came from the factory.
Not an issue with BMW, but with the App Waze. It always uses the BMW speakers via Bluetooth for audio, and I have to manually change it to the phone speakers, so that I can listen to music saved on my iPod.
Complicated to set radio station memory.  I-pod nearly impossible to understand.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
We originally could set the i-pod to play in alphabetical order.  It no longer does and we haven't been able to figure it out.
More decorative than functional





: the small cover for the hitch pops off if bumped - this appears to be a common problem - mine was missing - it was either stolen or a car bumped into mine and cased itto come off---
: in cold temperatures the windshield wiper fluid tubes freeze - and wont work it takes about 15 minutes to run defroster on high to get them to clear up.I thought I was out of fluid but a garagist explained the problem.

I feel that in most vehicle that I drive, there is a standard distance between pedals where I can simply plant my heel and reach both pedals. For me this is not true in the BMW X1. The brake pedal is not only close to the Gas pedal, it also sits what seems to me much closer to the bottom of the Dashboard. I think I would describe it as if another vehicle gas pedal sits at 45 Degree angle towards my foot the BMW X1 feels like its closer to a 90 Degree angle parallel to the vehicle floor. When braking, I must lift my foot and press the brake. While it isn't difficult, it takes about half a second longer to brake in Stop and Go, Bumper to Bumper type of traffic. That .5 second makes a difference and at this point I still feel like I'm not 100% adjusted to the vehicle braking.
Faulty component - fixed at dealer at no cost
rattle noise near the back of the vehicle while driving.


Fuel tank sensor did not work . Car fuel tank had to be replaced in 2nd month of ownership- car was in the dealer for 1 week.
: as described
When in reverse car brakes make a lot of noise
Shuts on and off
: We connected two iPhones.  One phone somehow got disconnected and I have not been able to reconnect.
: One of the memory settings  does not adjust.
have to toggle back and forth to get the overhead view on when backing up .

slight drip from sunroof over driver when it rains for more than 10-20 minutes.   Will report when taking vehicle in
I don't have a floor mat issue with the standard mats, my issue is the BMW 2018 X3 does not have snow floor mats until March/April 2018.   They have floor liners, but this does not contain the water and salt.   Car is filthy inside because of the salt/water goes right to the carpet.   Came out with a car but did not come out with snow floor mats at same time - terrible for michigan weather.
The handsfree opening feature of the trunk does no reliably work. I have to try and trigger it a few times to get it to work and sometimes end up just pressing the button.
: When traveling on the highway there is wind noise inside the vehecle
Vehicle manuals have to be manipulated to close the glove box as the door interior has an raised area that prohibits the door from closing without holding the manuals up. Very inconvenient.
I don't believe the wind noise is a defect but rather needs to be addressed in future designs.  I also own a 2018 Audi Q5 and it is far quieter
The dealer and BMW engineering are looking into this.  The vehicle fades to the left.  It is most noticeable when speeds are 60+.  The factory alignment was adjusted per BMW and it made little difference
The starter failed
Connectivity to Apple is not as smoothe as it should be at all.
You can hear the wind/traffic while driving at all speeds... It almost seems like a window isn't all the way up, but I check all the windows and they are completely up and sunroof is closed
The fuel cap attachment strap easily becomes disconnected from the car frame
icons not obvious in meaning
The car has Apple play. Often does not automatically load or activate. phone needs to be paired between uses
Will not retract completely and will get caught in the door when closing. I had the same problem with my previous BMW
: The trunk release button on the remote is far too sensitive and pops open all the time just from being in my pocket.
This may be more of an iPhone iOS issue than BMW's fault. The phone will disconnect randomly from the car dropping calls and/or audio.
Exactly as described above
: The rear seats wont fold down due to the seatbelts when pushing them foward from the trunk

The turbo wastegate rod was bent at assembly and caused a power loss : Turbo wastegate rod was slightly bent at assembly and caused performance issues.

Takes a long time to heat up
Response, when using the car appears random. Sometimes pairs seamlessly, time after time, other times, not. Idrive response is so random, it is not really clear what will turn on and display each time I start the car. Usually, I can move through the menu and 'reset' the idrive to the prior set up and get it to connect to my phone, but this can be a 5 min or more process multiple times a week. : Continues to occur, as stated previously, random,
: Display freeze. Couple of time
Can't turn off
trunk would open in drive while at a red light, happened twice.
no idea what happened other than the trunk just opened on it self
The BMW Connected App function to connect to the Spotify App must frequently be re-initiated.
Check engine light indicated a faulty coil pack for the #6 cylinder. The problem was quickly identified and resolved during a short service appointment.
It's very hard to see in the rear view mirror once the night vision controls are on. I called the genius line and was told there was no way to turn it off

I can make calls through the  blue tooth but it will not recognize my music. I have call the BMW genius line and was told they were experiencing some trouble with I phones. I bought a google pixel2 and have the same problem

Hard top convertible ,BMW claims it is weight of roof

cup holder is too close to radio/dash. if it were moved back an inch it would be fine. large drinks and insulated carriers do not fit all the way in holder, top of the drink hits the radio/dash.



Control usually shows off road to right when not off road.

: drivers seat wont elevate hiogh euough.

Chips in the front hood area.  Unsure of cause
: Back up camera is set to show green and red lines.  However, its response it erratic.  The lines don't show most of the time although the camera works correctly.  I'm sure the problem is fixable.  I just need the time to get to the dealer and have it looked at.
when closig the doors the widows seem to rattle
Coming from center console near the dash or behind the dash. Did not occur until end of first month. I have not brought in for service yet



are to fit items in there and to close
hard to put items in the side door without being in an awkward position especially while driving
hard to get in and out

Sometimes if my phone is in my purse on the front passenger seat, it will say that there is no device available...doesn't recognize that it is in the car. Doesn't happen all of the time, just periodically.
: Not sure if this is a problem, but I don't like that when I turn the heat on, I have to be careful and remember to turn off the A/C button which seems to always automatically come on for some reason.
I just don't like the mat because it has too many very high ridges throughout. Wish it was like their previous mats which had a textured but flatter surface.
I detailed this under 'other exterior issues.' : Apparently the tint on the right, front passenger window was not applied correctly because it looks like it is developing air bubbles at a couple of spots. Looks like a film that was not adhered correctly popping up in places.
Could be the operator  but I have set the exterior mirrors to driver number 1 and it doesn't remember my settting.
Just had trouble figuring out how to use the wipers 
They take a lot of pressure or hard slamming to close, not like the other BMW's I have owned. Hoping they LOOSEN UP A BIT

Mirror changes position to downward in reverse, but occasionally does not return to an upright position once you start driving. It takes some effort to get it adjusted again.
If cups are in holder, very difficult to use power outlet. Not enough power outlets in front or rear.
: I have tried multiple times to begin my trial subscription of SiriusXM but have been unable to get it started.
After 3 months of use it is still very difficult to hook the belt in without looking directly at it because it is difficult to reach
Cup holders are too small to fit any standard water bottles that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve tried. The location of the front cup holders is terrible because the overhang means only the shortest and narrowest container will fit, which means those containers don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hold much. The diameter of the front cup holders are too small.
When I put the car in park to take about 30 seconds to check the mail, it will shut the car down. This may be the way it is √¢‚Ç¨≈ìprogrammed√¢‚Ç¨¬ù but it sure is inconvenient. Is there some way to prevent this?
It happens occasionally when backing out of garage in the morning.
The right rear cargo speaker rattled on particluar songs. I was able to repeat it dor the service deparment and thw speaker was replaced
Car seems to idle loudly on cold days
See previous answer. Seems loud on cold mornings
I live in Ohio and I leased the car on Black Friday 2017.  It was really cold here and within the second week of having the car the light popped on.  I had to go into the dealership to get my plates around that same time.  While there one of the service reps saw the light and drove the car to make sure it was nothing wrong with the way the car drove.  We scheduled the car for service for approximately two weeks later.  The service rep thought it could have possibly be a sensor. Classic picked up the car and kept the car and look it over and found nothing wrong with the vehicle.  So I also concluded that it was probably a sensor.  I was really icy during that time here in Cleveland.
When we shop bought and took delivery of the vehicle it was nearly dark. About two weeks later during the day with the sun hitting at a certain angle we noticed the small dent at the top door frame on the driver's side.  I did bring to the dealership attention especially since I have the vehicle on a lease program. The sales rep wasn't concerned. However we wanted record of it for when we turn the vehicle back in we are dinged for it.
The wiper controls  are basically behind the steering wheel making it difficult the see the desired setting while driving.
When I speak a street name it pulls up something different than what I stated. I'm sure it has something to do with the accent although with BMW being sold around the world it should be able to identify any accent.
when a cup, bottle, etc. are placed in the cup holder the cup, bottle, etc. are on top of the controls. I have to remove the drink in order to adjust any of the control buttons. Impossible to use controls with drink in the cup holder.Again nothing the dealership can correct it's a manufacture error : 1. Sun visor when flipped to the side window doesn't extend out to the length of the door window to block the sun as the 528i did.2. Cup holders are right next to the dashboard controls so placing a larger cup  in the cup holder has the cup rubbing up against the dashboard control buttons. It seems as though cup holders should have been designed away from the dashboard controls.3. Seat width seems more narrow and doesn't adjust with the controls4. trunk size smaller on the Plug-in Hybrid than it was on the 528iThe next question ask if I've taken the problem to the dealer.  None of these issues are things a dealer can correct.
When pulling sun visor to the side it doesn't telescope out to extend longer to block the sun therefore serves no purpose.This isn't anything a dealership could correct. It's manufacture error : 1.

A few weeks ago the 'check engine light' came on while I was driving out of town. It stayed on all day and went off later. I took the vehicle to the dealership the next day but nothing was found. On a drive from Louisiana to Florida just recently the 'check engine light' came on again and stayed on for several hundred miles then went off. The vehicle doesn't seem to operate nor run badly when the light comes on. So unsure why it continues to come on but diagnostic test don't identify anything. How will I know when something is wrong?
While driving you can hear a noise of something in the rear passenger tire sounds like something was grinding the first 3 weeks we had it. not it only does it once in awhile.
When I put items on the passenger seat, it is to sensative and insists on alarming the 'Fasten Seat Belt' warning.  I just click the seat belt and put say, a box on top of it.  I haven't told the dealer because I figure more safety is better safety if a child is in the seat or so.
The alarm would go off after locking the car.  Sometimes, it would go off within 60 seconds and sometimes 60 minutes.

: Foot activated trunk opener failed.
A dull spot on the passenger side top of front fender. Appeared to be no clear coat.
Had to take in so they could open for me. Still experience difficulty opening once in a while.
the speaker has been replaced. speaker was under drivers seat.
Occasionally after being parked outside all day, the brakes squeak when I reverse out of my parking spot.
The position of the cup holders make it hard to get drinks in or out.

Gripping or grinding when I first start out. Only recently started. Goes away after a short distance
: The contacts on my phone would not sync with the audio system.

: The touch screen entertainment and vehicle monitor system has rebooted itself when the vehicle does an engine off/on to save gas. the computer monitoring system acts like I'm starting the engine for the first time when I'm not.
when opening the rear hatch water leaks from both sides in rear
: White car both front door sills always dirty poor seal I think at bottom

I prefer to use my iPhone over the built in system
It's on the console- you cannot look at the button and the screen and drive all at the same time
No surround sound.  No depth to the sound.
BMW says it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an Apple problem.  Apple says it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a BMW issue.
The controls are not intuitive and despite several readings of the instruction manual, I continue to have problems.  Plus the Apple Car Play feature has repeatedly stopped working.
Seatbelt hits me at an awkward height√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùright across the throat.  Space between door and seat belt buckle is so limited that the belt scrapes against the door every time. : The second time I drove the car, I got a message that the passenger seat restraints were malfunctioning.
The noise appears to be related to the tracks.
Self explanatory from the above.
There are chips or blemishes in the glass.
the motion sensor feature does not seem to be working.  Kicking my foot under the rear of the car used to open and/or close the trunk.  It is no longer working.
I am a petite sized person and the seat belt runs high across my neck and chest.  I would have liked an option to move it down.  I have had that with other cars I have driven.
The steering in this 428i is much different than my previous 335 and M 235. The steering wheel leaves me not feeling as connected to the road as my previous vehicles.
Also poor reception at intersections/stop lights. I was told this stereo had HD radio. It does not.
The scrolling dial on the console is difficult to use. And the touch drawing of letters and numbers is inaccurate.
Pin 17 at EDC module was pushed back and not fully making contact.
shoes may scuff the door panel on entry and exit of car
Wind noise occurs when windows are open. The wind seems create a reverberating noise when one window is open and the others are closed. The buffeting noise is less when more than one window is open.
There seems to be water spots or some other type of spots related to delivery that just won't come off.  I've had waxed and taken back to BMW but somehow not thrilled that this is a new car with that issue.  My sales guy is awesome and he had it detailed for me and they went away, until I had it washed again after the rain.  Not sure what it could be.
Just seems to be an extended delay at connection and very cumbersome for the bluetooth to work.  Sometimes it works well, other times not so much.
Entering the address from the connected App is much easier--the dial is just too much entry and too slow of a process.  Needs redesign
I have short arms so it may just be me but the glove box doesn't close well if you have anything in it other than well...gloves.
THE LOCATION, BEHIIND THE SHIFT LEVER, MAKES IT HARD TO INSERT AND REMOVE ITEMS.
I think that the noise is really normal and that since it is a sports car and i have never driven one i was not used to what a sports car should sound or feel like. I took it to the dealer for a test drive and the dealer put me in a differnt vehicle but was the same make and model and tires and the sound in the suspension was the same.
Not a big deal, but I haven't had this problem with my previous BMW's.  Normally I would just keep the air conditioning on and I would never have to worry about it.
we were shown how the self-parking system works by the guy at the dealership, and I know there are YouTube videos that provide instructions; I just haven't been able to do it myself in a real-life situation, and I haven't taken the time to try it out somewhere where there's no hurry, so I can learn it without holding up city traffic. : None, and the parking assist issue isn't a 'problem' per se, it's just operator ignorance.

: Fan did not work.  Low refrigerant from factory.

It may just be my lack of experience with an auto tail gate but sometimes when I push the buttons to close and lock it, it stops part way down.
I hear what I perceive to be excessive wind or road noise when I am driving.  To me the interior cab is not as quiet as I thought it would be.  I found myself constantly pulling up on the window toggles thinking that perhaps one of the windows was lowered.
I find that the turn signal does not easily turn off and the double option is confusing it ends up that I go to turn the signal off and turn it on for the other direction
When I look at the time on the dash board, I am assuming it is the middle number but that is the miles, I think the clock should be in the middle, where you eye naturally goes
Perhaps I am just used to my old car, but I find the bliss indicator to be in an inconvenient place that I often do not see
The steering wheel goes from very hot to not warm at all, I don't know if the temperature cycles or not.
I will often say a command such as call such and such and I am directed somewhere else.  I ask it to find a number and I am given directions.
I have the light beige interior and when I wear jeans, the denim leaves a blue dye on the seats.  The dealer tried to clean it but could not.  I ended up having to use a magic eraser on the seat.  Unfortunately because I have the extendable seat, I cannot find a seat cover that will work, plus I don't want to have to cover my seats.
you cannot easily put the owners manual in the glovebox, the box is not well designed
The split open console cover is not hard to open but it is awkward to open
: I got a warning light that there was an issue, ended up being that a spark plug was not working
Has trouble syncing to audio file playlists.  Skips and repeats songs, returns to the beginning of a playlist.
Appears to originate from the retractable cover for the cargo area.  Seems to vibrate or rattle when going over bumps.  If the cargo cover is removed, the noise is no longer present.
Same experience as rear door
On some occasions pulling the latch to open door is weird to operate as the latch seems to resist your pull, so I have to pull it again and harder making me fear I would damage when I pull harder. It also makes a weird noise when I pull harder.
It is the sunglass compartment on driver side just underneath left side of steering wheel and close to where your left leg knee is when driving. the compartment is so awkwardly shaped that things fall off when trying to store them. Also it is difficult to make up to 2 sunglasses fit in the compartment. Still love the car though
It is just a little heavier than a normal car.  Happens with every bmw.
It happens very rarely , and its a road surface issue.  Certain road surfaces like concrete rather than tarmac will cause a high frequency resonating sound in the front wheels.  Nobody seems to know why at the dealer and it isn't very easy to replicate due to only certain road surfaces causing the issue.  We have an agreement that if the issue persists after the first service or gets worse then we will replace some parts.
Placement makes it difficult to use.
The lights do not always go on when there is a car in the blind spot.  Therefore, they are of little use.
Apple CarPlay takes over and does not allow for other uses such as XM Radio.

This has been a consistent issue with all of my X5s
Stiff suspensiom
The seat belt setting for the front passenger seat is set such that I am unable to set my phone or my purse on the passenger seat without the seat belt warning sound going off.  I took the vehicle into the dealer and the service department was unable to find anything wrong with it.  However, I must keep my phone in one of the cup holders and my purse on the floor so that the seat belt warning sound does not go off. : The only seating problem I have experienced is the setting for the seat belt warning on the front passenger seat which I previously explained.
The seat scuffs are very minor but I must wipe the seats frequently to keep them clean.
Air conditioning is confusing. Once we had hot air blowing from below the driver seat due to my driver seat heating function was on.....and it was heating the rear zone...I had to attend technology clinic to understand the function.
Too sensitive. Too easy to turn on.
Would be better located on metal trim adjacent to center of wheel.
: iPhone music syncs slowly with car and is confusing to figure out.
Unable to detect appropriate parking spaces more than half of the time. Also, sometimes the system turns on and sometimes it doesn't when I want it to turn on to park a car.
problem with cooling and not being able to maintain temperature so fan is on for an excessive amount of time
Appears that the air conditioning on the passenger side doesn't cool appropriately and just blows outside air.
Time is hard to see on the screen or dashboard
: Seats are not comfortable. Could have had more cushion
Did not understand how the temperature control works. Set the temp at 80, but still get cold air
I put 80 F, bu I see the cold is blowing to me.
I am experiencing this problem on driver side. Sure same other side too
When I try to leave my spects over the manual, it slides next to the book which interferes in closing the box. Once items are in,, the closing should be smooth. Else prevent to place things in the glove bos
The cup holders and the storage needs to be have easily accessible layout. Cups have good accessibility but not the storage space
Does not open when kicked. : Boot. Does not open up when kicked.
Cameras don't turn on all the time. Sometimes not working.
it does not vibrate all the time.
I've had a lock sensor in previous cars, but this one is by far the least sensitive. I sometimes can't even get it to work and have to go to the back door to lock the doors.
The door seems loose and wonky. It's doesn't seem to fit the quality of the rest of the car.
This is a very minor complaint. The user manual doesn't fit in the glove compartment adequately.
The space is dedicated to your phone for charging , but since I don't have one, I typically put my sunglasses in there. It is difficult to reach when there are cups in the cup holders.
I think it is just a sensitivity issue.All depending of car location.This is not a life or death issue.Speed is not always good.

Doesn't always recognize addresses.  Doesn't recognize names in contact list.  Paired to the BMW system through Bluetooth, not Apple Car play.
Slow to connect, and because I have more than 1 phone paired, it gets confused between phones.

SOMETIMES I CANNOT GET THE DOORS TO LOCK WITHOUT USING MY KEYLESS REMOTE AND IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING
Didn't know where/how to find my mileage on the vehicle.
It almost is like when the child safety lock is on.  You have to pull on the handle twice before it opens
It doesn't always work.  Need to pair / unpair, turn car on off.  Sometimes it says its playing but there's no sound.
More air volume through the seats would be nice.  ALso, ventilators default from high to medium automatically when I prefer for them to remain on high setting.

hit a pothole and it blew out the tire!   No spare!!!  need a spare tire.  run flat tires do not do any good when dealer is 150 miles away. : hate run flat tires.  put a spare in the car.
does not recognize English words.
Your navigation system is horrible.  does not take you the most direct route no matter what options you put in.
when I have drinks in cup holders, you cannot access the AC controls!  Poor design.
Air conditioning just stops working and hot air blows out.
In reverse, right mirror drops too low and then does not return to original position
: Seat heater gets burning hot on the lowest setting.Height of Seat belt or seat can not be adjusted so seat belt cuts into neck.
Seat heater gets burning hot on the lowest setting.Height of Seat belt or seat can not be adjusted so seat belt cuts into neck.


Scratches on right rear side molding and on left door area
Car was in Neutral on a slight incline and the hand brake was full extended; however, the car moved to the rear without any application of acceleration.
Paint chipped on trunk of car.
Can hear wind or air coming through window seals.

Answered in a previous response. : Drivers seat belt buckle is too low and can be difficult to buckle. Not a big issue, will take it in when some maintenance is needed.
when it arrived or in the show room there was a paint chip and small ding on the rear rim over the tire that the dealer repaired.
: the front lights and fog lights fog and build up moisture inside when it rains.

Probably brakes being new

The vehicle voice response repeats/interprets different words than I have spoken/driver. Don't know if the system is still trying to learn how to recognize my voice.
Noticed after driving for awhile.

Can only hold small bottles. No adjustability.
The visor is to small and does not block the sun most of the time.
The initial warning of low tire pressure did not indicate which tire was the problem.  It was only later, when the pressure was even lower that it indicated which tire was the problem.
The time is small and appears in different places and is hard to find.
Im nervous using it and feel out of control.  I also am not sure what to expect or how to practice using it so I feel safe.
: It does not save my favorite radio stations.  It does save my favorite places and my favorite satellite stations but not the am and fm stations.
When I want to call someone or when I want to go somewhere and I say the name or place it does not understand me.  This only happens occasionally and only certain names or places.  Also when I dictate a message to be sent it will miss words or will make up new words.  I try repeating it and it still gets it wrong.  Sometimes it sends gibberish.
Sometimes it takes me to closed roads and then keeps trying to reroute me back to the closed road when I dont turn on it.
The cover over the track of the seat in the back behind the drivers seat lifted up and wont go back down.
Air doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem to blow out of driver front vent
System fairly frequently fails to recognize spoken destination addresses.

Window will sometimes not close instead it will go up and then open all the way again
It says airbag is not on but no idea where the control for the air bag is


It smells like air condition
: Rubber lining on driver side door has a small split/hole
The clock is not consistently in the same place. It can sometimes be on the navigation display, but depending on what screen is pulled up - it can disappear. Same for on main instrument display.  The clock disappears when I have less than 30 miles left of gas due to text about gas mileage being displayed.  Then I am left without a visible clock display, which I definitely use.
Just recently noticed that there might be an issue on the passenger side blind spot warning system...indicator didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t blink when I expected it to, but need to further test to see if there is actually an issue or if it was through fault of my own.
Issues/ conflicts between CarPlay and Bluetooth apps like Waze

Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t notice much difference when using the ventilation option
Within a few weeks of having the car noticed discoloration of my driver side seat
Feel as though I have to crank the temp way down in order to cool the car within a reasonable amount of time
While I certainly noticed it happening, I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say that it happens everytime I drive the car - but enough that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve noted it.
It appears that there was black or a dark paint that was mixed in to the light blue, which caused minor imperfections in the paint.
It doesn't give the right coolness according to the selected temperature I have to put the ac on max and at 60 degree until it feels Cold enough



I accidentally added this note on the EXTERIOR comments section of the survey, but it's actually harder to see through the window with the wipers ON -- they streak the water terribly across the window, and they are incredibly LOUD/SQUEAKY!!   Then, when the water dries, the window is just as hard to see through!  I've had cheap Toyota rentals from Enterprise with better wipers. : The windshield wipers are terrible; they squeak loudly, and streak the water across the window; it's actually harder to see through the rain when the wipers are on - that's how much of a mess they make.  Then,when the water dries, the windshield is just as blurry.  Because it doesn't rain much in Southern California, I didn't realize this problem until 2 months after I bought the car.
In this 4-door vehicle, the rear doors do not unlock with the main front doors, NOR do they unlock when you grab the handle  like the front doors; the point of having 4-doors is to make life easier with kids, but not being able to easily unlock the back door contradicts 'making life easier'.
There is a new BMW feature called 'CarPlay' that doesn't seem helpful at all; it connects intermittenly, prevents normal operation of radio/phone; even when disabled, the car tries to connect to Pandora through the phone.  There are no clear instructions in any of the provided manuals.  Overall, phone/bluetooth connectivity is fine - all contacts sync, phone calls work great, etc.  But these other 'features' are intermittent and hard to control.
The ease of operations of sunroof with different options  is not friendly and easy to understand.
not easy to operate
the vehicle stops itself and brakes are applied without any alert or notification. It happened twice. I have lodged a formal complaint with BMW- North America. Have issue reported to BMW dealer also.
defrost for windshield does not clear easily
the fog on windshield does not get clear easily. The button is for Max defrost which is noisy. There is no normal defrost button for the windshield like we have for rear window.
At times this is very dangerous situation, it takes good time to defrost.
Not intuitive or as easy to operate as others I have experienced. Have to look down to operate, taking eyes off the road.



It is not as easy to use as I thought it would be.
The automatic control doesn't seem to achieve the temperature.
Automatic temperature does not achieve desired temperature.
There is not much space and a lot of extra space under the arm rest that could be closed storage.
The issue is after selecting temperature. The previous BMW models featured a thumb wheel just above the air vents with blue/red marks. After setting basic temperature, the thumb wheel could be used to get hotter or cooler air based on what the driver desired. The same function still exists on the 2018 5 series, however it is now a digital feature which can only be accessed through the iDrive screen by selecting 'Menu' which then takes you to the page where you can adjust the climate. This works fine while stopped, however when moving it can be a distraction especially to someone unfamiliar with how the system works. I understand why BMW chose to make this feature digital, however it is not as intuitive as it previously was as a physical thumb wheel.
THERE IS NO SPECIFIC BUTTONS TO USE TO HEAT THE INSIDE OF THE CAR OTHER THAN TURNING ON THE AC AND ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE MANUALLY OR TURNING ON THE DEFROSTER
: sometimes the lumbar area is too sharp leaving undesired pressure points
driver rear door won't auto unlock when I unlock car with my hand/thumb touch...I either have to use my fob to push button on get into front of car and push the unlock button
Can't get the auto sensor when I kick my foot underneath to open trunk.   Manually is fine.
Scratched you could tell someone had scrapped a curb.
dent
brakes way too sensitive
needs to have more depth/deeper
way to close to dash
I noticed the weather seats will pick up die from jeans that are not new and turn the seats blue I'm constantly cleaning this off.
: A few times the backup camera errors out.
The clearance when a can is placed in the cup holder to the lower portion of the display panel makes it difficult to insert & remove without rubbing against the panel.
In general, there is not enough room for the phone charger and cup holders.  That is one of my few gripes about the car
Left foot dead pedal is too low and not even with gas pedal.
Car sometimes fails to recognize iPod.  Sometimes first 1-2 seconds of song repeat over and over again for 20-30 seconds before song plays .
Seat is twisted 5-10 degrees to the left and un-level, causing an uncomfortable seat.
When the vehicle accelerates in first gear, and you do not have a smooth acceleration, it will stumble until second gear.
Typical BMW issue - a lot of effort to turn at low speeds.  Slow acceleration from start - check out how smooth an Audi is by comparison.  At higher speeds I like the BMW better!  Dream on highways but too much work in local traffic

General comments- steering wheel gets too hot.  Check out Audi steering wheel heat.- I love the heads-up display- Voice recognition is superb- don't know how to use lane departure and collision avoidance.  I would say poor controls - weird green button near hazard button.  BMW can do much better!
I don't know how it works.  It should be intuitive! : - Use Audi roller control for volume.- use Audi size rear view mirrors - even Toyotas/Nissan and Hyundai have better collision avoidance systems/auto braking.  Shame on BMW!
It gets too hot - it should be just warm!

: Auto trunk opening by √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwaving√¢‚Ç¨¬ù foot under is not working
Too many steps to tune radio.Simple preset buttons made too complex.Too many main options if only use radio or cd.
Menu options and structure is unclear and difficult to use.
first visit dealer indicated they couldn't find any issue why the CE light came onSecond visit dealer indicated multiple issues and opened a puma case.....resulted in a software reset/update .  later found out another software update is available and should be installed for my anticipated third trip to the dealer in 3 months of ownership : check engine light came on twice within the first 1000 miles ;   2 separate trips to the dealer

Sometimes the fuel door doesn't latch unless you lift it slightly when closing it.
time display very small in a small area
you have to press hard
its tight area not easily seen bc of the interior color
my cup container mug doesn't fit the cup holder area is too short. had to buy a cupholder and place on the side doesn't look nice.
warning light in outside mirror. too far away. must turn head slightly. have had system in a volvo which was on inside a pillar. much quicker recognition.
steering was way off.  took to dealer and they corrected but I told them steering wheel is not 'straight'.  the technician was great. he took 2 test rides with me.  It's hard to tell sometimes if it is still pulling or if it is just the road causing the car to pull.  Either way, the steering wheel isn't quite straight.
We try not to touch the doors with our shoes when we open the doors but if we do it tends to scuff very easily.
Foot pedal is too far apart from bottom of the ground compared to other cars in the class. It is not a negative but even my wife complains about this. Definitely could have made it an inch lower.
The female connect for the seat belts are too low  The are difficult to reach and when the arm rest is down its almost impossible to find it.
The seat belt just gets tangled sometimes  Don't know why.  not a big problem.
Trunk hardly ever opens when I kick under the base of the car.  Reluctant to open automatically with key when cold outside.  opens in increments until I force it open against resistance
They make a grinding sound when I come to a stop.  The dealer reseated the brakes but the noise continues.  told this was a feature of the BMWE X1
The seat belt sits across my throat.  No adjustability for a 5 foot tall woman.  Engineers need to pull seat forward as a small person must do to reach the pedals.  Then design a belt that is one size fits all or has some adjustability
auto sensor at ground level does not open back hatch reliably when passing foot below sensor
sometimes the system notes vehicles in blind spot, sometimes not
unclear what makes the alarm activate
could not find way to get air where it was desired
does not come to set temperature, too warm on a cold day
The system is hard to engage and really not needed
: I have sirius set to preset ststiond i have programmed but sometimes when i start vehicle it haz switched back to all channels instead of staying programmed on pfeset


: The driver's side rear seat latch did not latch completely.
In reverse whilst parking, the brakes will squeel loudly. However, I have not experienced this going forward.
The parking indicators do were yellow vs. RED yet still scraped under front on curb
Additionaly, the 'weather' feasture often states 'NO GPS,' however, the gps will work for navigation. Randomly occurs.
Frequently unpairing of the Apple Carplay followed by completely wrong words.
Apple CarPlay disconnects randomely, reconnects after resetting.
Easily shiped then crack spread from minor road debris, replacement and recalibration is time consuming. : Windshield cracked under normal debris conditions
The steering wheel scraches easily from buttons or zippers
When more AC power is working, engine response is delayed.
Fuel consumption can be attrocious depending on the 'mode.'
Usually the fully automatic shifts at awkward times.  Semi-Manual is prefered.

Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t always adjust to my key settings I have to manually change : Lost memory settings
No adjustments for shorter people
: Battery discharge issue. Turned out to be a slow discharge from a communications module. Fixed by BMW dealer.
Vinyl has small tear.

Very small.  Not much fits in it.
: I have twice noticed that when I am parked and put car in reverse to leave a parking space and then place car in Drive, the car does not move forward in Drive.  it appears that car slips into park.
BMW brake pads on this vehicle produce an excessive amount od sticky, black dust that coats the wheels.  The wheels must be cleaned every week after only a few hundred miles of driving.
The X3 has a low level. low frequency rattle over bumps that seems to be from behind the dashboard, but is difficult to localize.  It's not very loud, but is annoying.
Too small
The center console is extremely small...........cannot put more than my wallet and keys in it....... the storage unit under the radio, etc with the phone charger, and computer port is very small and hard to plug in chargers, etc.
The glove box was redesigned and is now too small to even hold the cars manual. They also reduced the size of the compartment to the left of the steering wheel where I used to store sunglasses, now it's too small for that.

HEAT DOES NOT BUILD UP IN THE COLD WEATHER, MASSENA, NY.

After just a couple months of use, the seat is already stained blue due to wearing jeans.
I wish I could lower the head rest more
when door is closed it is very hard to reach the controls

When I back out of my parking area the brakes will squeak initially.
: When in Apple Carplay mode, the built-in Navigation system of the vehicle is disabled and nothing appears in the headsup display.  So carplay must be disabled, you cannot select the factory Nav system when in carplay mode,  That's annoying.  Also, the controls for switching from Carplay to the BMW Connected drive mode are laborious.  This a design issue.

This was noted in an online review as well.  There is a gap and sharp edge where some plastic material on the inside of the door handle meets the padded portion.
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not all the time it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just like sometimes I gets confused but most the time is ok
Sometimes my Pandora or iTunes music doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sync with my phone and the display will say error of external object or something to that effect. And I have to close the apps a few times before it syncs up with the car again.
I have left items on the passenger seat like my purse or food in a bag and the items have left a mark. Not a big issue. Easy to clean.
It seems that the door does not want to stay open to the 2nd/widest open set point.  It almost always swings back to the lower position or closes partially.
The cup holder is too small for most standard travel coffee cups, I have many!
Controls not intuitive.  Had to consult manual several times.  Does not respond as quickly as I think it should.
Not intuitive.  Do not give sufficient output
I have to manually break. It is fast and uncomfortable
Wouldn't consistently connect to the phone whenever I got in the car -- one time it would, the next time it wouldn't.  Problem has been largely corrected thanks to a firmware update on my phone, so it didn't appear to be a problem with the car after having the BMW service department look at the problem.
Minor dent. Dealer will correct. Dent noted by dealer.
: The I drive would somehow automatically restart while I was driving. It only happened once, but it was somewhat scary as the navigation was active but the I-drive just went blank and restarted, much like how my laptop restart, as I was driving.  It also happen another time when the I-drive quit while the vehicle was in motion and just lost all connection including blue tooth streaming and navigation but did not 'reboot'.  this happened on the 3rd month after delivery and I plan to bring it back to the dealership for a check very soon.
the rear window washer has an occasional leak, so the dealer is replacing it
: Charging port has pulled away from the mounting wall within the driver armrest compartment

: Snow on trunk door slid easily into where trunk closes and prevented me from closing trunk. I had to manually clean out every bit of snow to get trunk to close


Very complicated system.  Not truely automatic. Requires multiple steps to get correct temperature. Air conditioner not powerful enough.
Already described
My feet hit the brake pedal when depressing the accelerator.
Poor location to place them under the center console

Takes multiple attempts at times.
Squeal relatively infrequently.
Didn't notice at the dealership, but on the way home .  Reported the next morning, via email.  Windshield was immediately ordered from Germany and installed when I was able to return to the dealership.
: Front end had a residue on paint. Told dealership about this and they told me to buy some  Simple Green and scrub it off.. thought r so he may have resulted from the transport!
See above. Raised seat too high while car was parked. Then tried to recline and did not work. All because seat raised too high....system locked up because of this. : Car not completely detailed when it was delivered. Also, moved passenger seat and controls became non-responsive. Turns out seat was raised too high which made it unresponsive to the seat controls.   Called dealership to report and they had me take in for service√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùvery inconvenient for me. They should have known in service department I simply had to lower the seat to make controls operational again
Feels like if I pushed on plastic covering cockpit controls I could make noise stop. Almost 100,000 car√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùunacceptable to hear these noises after 1500 miles.


The dealer ordered a new part and fixed it. No  further problems since then. They also gave me a loaner car for a couple of hours. The problem was the fuel button was defective and could not communicate with the fuel door.
: 1. I hear outside noise quite loudly inside the car.  For example, the noise inside the car is pretty amplified while driving in a tunnel.2. Fuel door opens randomly.  The latch/hold mechanism is poorly designed.
: 1. I hear outside noise quite loudly inside the car.  For example, the noise inside the car is pretty amplified while driving in a tunnel.2. Fuel door opens randomly.  The latch/hold mechanism is poorly designed.
There is a sporadic rattle noise that I have not been able to pinpoint.  I have confirmed it is from the car .  It feels like it comes from the front right hand side of the hood, approximately.  But it is not consistent.
It is definitely not intuitive.  I know the car has the system, but I am yet to locate it from scanning the steering wheel and instrument panel.  I might have to go through a bulky manual to even understand how it works.
: The engine feels slightly choky - I feel a slight stutter while driving in regular auto mode 
Have visited the dealer two times to have it diagnosed. Need to have the replacement part shipped from Germany which takes about two weeks. Probably won't need this function in two weeks in my area after spring comes.
The front 12V power outlet  intermittently won't make contact with the inserted plug.  The same plug works fine in the other two 12V outlets.
The navigation system sent me to an entirely different location than the one I selected.
Had wipers replaced immediately after delivery  but still feel they do not sweep as cleanly as they might
Seems to be related to unused seat belt when there is no passenger in front seat
When you you exit either front seat oyour calf rubs on the running board. Consequently you have dirt on your slacks or leg. It is awkward to try to exit with this happening. It is the one aggravation with my X5
: The windshield wiper froze over in snow. Dealer replaced wiper and it solved the problem.
We set cabin temp at 70. On cold mornings in highway driving you feel cool air from vents.
Foot sensor to open trunk rarely picks up movement and opens when needed. Also the way the car is set up to unlock the doors is difficult. The button has to be pressed multiple times to unlock both front and rear doors. Once click should unlock all the doors.
button should be in a visible location, and have an option to stay on once pressed.
: The car's idle is set too high. If my foot comes off the brake pedal or isn't pressed down very firmly the car will lunge forward. Without even applying pressure to the gas pedal the car starts to move at a fast rate.
Paint was stained yellow in several places on right hand side. Looked like something that was wet and ran down side of body.
Start button located behind steering wheel. The 'ECO' button is hidden next to it and one can easily switch it on or off without realizing it while starting or stopping engine.
System does not recognize my commands. Need heavy american accent for the system to understand you.

Some roads in my area are missing. One major highway is missing from map.
Located next to seat. Need to 'feel' where controls are.
Located next to seat, not visible, need to 'feel' where the controls are.
next to seat, need to 'feel' where located.
Located next to seat, have to 'feel' where control is. Tilts seat back or forth if you do not operate the button correctly.
Controls are in difficult place. Can not see the controls. Would prefer it iInstalled on driver door.
Hard to clip in buckle, very small space between center console and body. Located too deep down.
Center console seems to get very, very warm.  Not sure why.
Camera does not have visual guides or sound a warning when in close proximity of an object or person.

I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m having problems understanding how to use the car√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s voice commands as opposed to Apple Car Play. It seems as though I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t use the car√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s features while Car Play is being used, which is always.



dont know
: Vehicle is too cold and take time to get warm
Dealer said to bring back for repair. Have not had time to do so due to winter weather.
 : I had to go back to the dealer 6 times to be able to program Spotify and Pandora.  Unfortunately I have to go thru a few steps each time I turn the car on.
must use short mug or cup. Most insulated bottles won't fit.
No AUX port provided
roof makes noise when it's cold
washer system not installed properly


It's difficult to get between the side of the seat and the middle console storage unit. The storage unit needs to be narrower to allow better buckling/unbuckling of the seat belt.
There are two catches on each side of the hood. When closing the hood, the left side latch  does not always catch the first time. I brought it by the shop and given how light the aluminum hood is, they showed me how to 'gently slam' slam the hood so it catches.
We are unable to remove rear headrests through repeated attempts to do so.
The passenger control does not show air to flow to the head. I have not been able to ask for help as my father has been very ill  since we took delivery of the car.
When I open the trunk by pressing the button on the key , it opens to low sometimes.  So i have to manually lift the trunk to make it open enough to put something in the trunk.
The brakes work.  They just feel a bit 'mushier' than my 2015 gran coupe that I just traded in.  However, I don't think they are actually malfunctioning.
Sometimes when I try to state the name of a business , it will not recognize it and I have to manually look up the physical address on the internet and then enter that into the navigation.  Obviously, being able to simply say the business name would be preferred because it's seamless.
noise is noticed at highway speeds...driver's side, perhaps around mirror or roof column
The turn signal display, located at the top behind the steering wheel is hard to see when I've lowered the steering wheel to a position that is comfortable for me to drive,If the display was at the bottom  that would never be a problem.
: One night, on a trip to LA, I started the car and pushed a CD into the player at about the same time and then the screen display blacked out and stayed that way.Turning the call off and restarting it didn't fix it. I drove it that way back to the hotel, thinking how difficult it's going to be driving back to Las Vegas with no music, phoneand all the other things the screen display controls. The next morning when I started the car, the screen was back on.
Two things: 1. When talking on the phone there isn't any way to release the call to go back to my phone for privacy if there is someone else in the car or when I drive home                       and the car is in the garage, I have to either complete the call sitting in the garage or hang up on the caller and call them back when I get in the house                    2. My iPhone captures the map and phone music and then it is difficult to go back to the car's map and music .
: when filling the fuel I heard a humming noise the was entermitant at first then stayed continuous at the end of the fill.I assumed it was pressure relief noise in the tank
When headlamps are on, one beam is lower than the other. Mismatched
Just a poor layout, I'm worried I'm going to wreck the vehicle as a result of the confusion trying to figure things out.
Just one lone port on this level of vehicle? And hidden inside a hinged compartment without ease of access. It's a process attaching and removing devices.



it  doesnt always unlock the doors ot the tailgate or save profiles
doesnt save the memory for driver profiles and doesnt always switch for the different keys

they do not fit properly
smells fishey when seat heater on
it doesnt save the selection to stop it
Won't always connect to the music on my iphone.

this vehicle drives TERRIBLY in the snow
I can not figure out how to operate the rear sunroom from the drivers seat.  I use the backseat buttons and they are not marked clear

Too small
: There is no audio auxiliary input on the factory radio to use auxliary device like a Serius Satelite radio to receive a particular Satellite channel which is not available on the factory unit. Have to use an FM channel to receive it and has interference as there is no FM channel that is completely interference free. A direct auxiliary input would not have that problem. The Serius unit has to be linked to the FM channel to receive it.
: The driver's seat height adjustment is very limited. Not amicable for a shorter person. More vertical adjustment is needed.
When the glove box is opened, the contents spill out on to the passenger's legs. Not user friendly.
I think it should get a little warmer than it does and it should be a little quicker. We also have a Jeep Cherokee with heated steering wheel and it is much warmer and quicker
Should warm up quicker
when weather is cold, shows lack of pressure in tire, even when tires are properly pressurized

it is an automatic door by using your foot.  must be exactly in in the right postion while working for it to work.  the range for error is to small.  kia has figures this out.
the sensors are not consistent with a sound responds as outined with the instructions in the opertors manaual. i.e. distance, speed respond sound is not consistent in the forward postion. there is an auto botton to chec for the vechicle but sometimes you must push the manaul button to to get a sensor sound to resond. it doesn't always respond when the condtions requiring a response or under identicl or simalar situations. the warning signal going forward are not trust worthy.
seems like the plastic shell. When pressure is put to it . can be remediated by changing seat positions
2 quarts in 1200 miles
: Seat belt buckle uckle latch is hard to reach near the door upon sitting in the driver's seat.  Too low.
Use to have led looks like regular bulbs now
Location
When listening to music , it will often stop playing and Apple Car Play will spontaneously take over the display.
Blue jean dye very easily transfers to front driver seat.
Insufficient storage space, poor layout once opened.
You are not able to disable the acceleration volume feature.  When listening to Apple Car Play it turns the volume up/down quite a bit and it is annoying.
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s temperamental.

Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work when apple car play is enabled.Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t load contacts.

gas door cover fell off 2nd day of ownership
auto wipers are very poor with little to no control --- it never selects the correct speed for the wipers --- automatic control is random when it comes on, speeds up, or slows down.  worst automatic wiper control I have ever had
very poor location to phone plug in
The foot operated release works about 75% of the time.  It is not dependable.
Almost every morning my brakes squeal as I back out of the garage.  Once I am in drive, the noise stops.
The water bottles I have do not fit.  The cup holders only accommodate small bottles.  Fast food drink cups in a size large also will not fit.  The holder is not size adjustable like in other vehicles.  It is one size fits all, but does not come close to fitting all.  I would label it 'one size fits a few.'
Phone pairing  drops while driving
brings me to wrong addresses : frustrating to be taken to the wrong address or the route is way off target
Seat does not raise hign enough
not enough options
not enough choices
seats are not made for short people
doesn't always work with the right key
with start at highest level cannot reach buckle...
VERY uncomfortable...Seams in bad places, too contoured, hard to get in and out of car
Only problem.  The complexity and number of features.
Seemed to be a charging issue per dashboard warning light.  Brought vehicle back to dealer who replaced the battery
: Hatch opens too high.  When in my garage and if the garage door is open, the hatch could hit the garage door that is up on the rails because it opens too high.  This is a potential issue when parking in a parking garage.  If you are parked under a roof beam, the hatch could hit it when opened.  There is no warning or alert to stop it.
When using Apple Car Play, it frequently defaults back to that screen when I'm trying to listen to standard radio.  I need to manually disconnect from ACP sometimes to have the radio function to my satisfaction
It's only on the first few minutes of the first ride in the morning 
It could be just how I drive but the brakes on my previous BMW were better
When I use the trunk release, it releases but it does not release from the lock position.  No were to grab to open it.
Driver side headlamp is aimed to low.
I am getting about 14mpg combined driving.
My understanding is that this is standard for the DCT in the M cars, simply just how it is.
: The vehicle has 'gesture control' for audio volume and other features that does not seem to work well.  It was not something I would have ordered on the vehicle in any case, and it can be turned off, which is the way I keep it all the time.  It seems like a frivolous option.
Pedal feels a bit soft under hard braking. Car stops ok, just doesn't feel solid like my previous BMWs. I do like the fact that my car doesn't generate the soot like my previous cars with I fixed with aftermarket pads. I assume I'll end up doing the same thing after the included maintenance is done. Will mention it at my first service call. Not bad enough to warrant a special trip.
: The parking assist seems too sensitive. All the bells and buzzers go off and I'm still a foot away from the curb. On my next scheduled trip to the dealer, I will see if there any settings that can be changed.
I say Sullivan drive in West Point, PA and it tries to take me to Kentucky????????
The navigation/voice recognition does a poor job in general. Waze on my phone works better and is easier to use. I would have preferred to have Android Auto which BMW doesn't provide. The only thing I really like about the system is the directions that are sent to the heads-up display.
: Seat warmers don't get very warm nor do they stay at the temperature that they reach.
: Back up camera goes black intermittently
Went away after 2-3 weeks.

I have the apple connect.  Somehow my phone pairing and my husband's pairing were completely wiped out.
If I have the window unrolled to reach my arm out  my deodorant soils the material and it is very hard to clean off. I have tried several different brands and it still happens. I
Blue-tooth connectivity is inconsistent.  May connect when I enter car and then later during same driving time, it doesn't connect.  Or sometimes doesn't connect on entry.  Using Apple-Play.
Goes right to pandora after turning car on, instead of satellite radio
: Rear window washer nozzle leaks under hard acceleration sometimes.  Maybe twice a week...
Car hesitates when in lower gears as I ease up to cruising speed..
too close to the dashboard should be further back  - awkard to use when driving
my driver's seat does not get as hot as the car I owned previously, which was the same model, x3, before the redesign. It's warm but not as warm as my last car. I plan on mentioning this to the dealer/service dept.

Sometimes it gives you the impression that you were parked closer to the line and a parking space than you really are. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not very intuitive.
Clutch pedal just made a clicking sound : Clutch pedal made a clicking sound.
Pirelli tires are noisy....quite sure the noise is tire noise.
had to replace entire assembly on the day after pick up.  None in stock had to wait 3 days for repair.

the cruise control should be on the right side of the steering wheel and not the left.
The location in the center console is not a good place
radio and temp controls very easy to confuse
understanding the controls are very difficult to understand what is foot vent mid vent and windscreen vent.  seperating or having them all on is really hard to understand by the indicator on the panel.
difficult to locate sensor underneath for foot operation
Bottom plastic trim piece rattles when closing the door.
When closing the doors the bottom plastic trim piece rattles.
Had a previous Generation 2016 X3 M-Sport 35 and the Brakes seemed to perform better in all conditions.The vehicle takes more effort to come to a stop.
Issue resides with Apple Car Play. The BMW Infotainment works flawlessly when i am using it.Apple Car Play issue is as such. Whatever Audio source i am listening to  will be cut off when a message or call comes in..... after the call is over or the message is done being dictated.... I have to manually switch back to the Audio i was listening to, since Apple Car Play has now taken over.
Happens after i wash the car for a while and the door seals seem to make a rubbing noise.Goes away after a little while.Doors rattle when they are closed, seems to come from the plastic trim at the bottom of the door on the outside.
The engine will shutdown before i come to a stop and as I am stopping I let up very slightly to not keep the same amount of pressure on the brakes and the car will restart .
: Audio continued to open ap on phone, unable to stop √¢‚Ç¨≈ìpandora√¢‚Ç¨¬ù from opening. Genius stated he had heard this issue but had no solution
They don't seem to work all the time. When my husband gets into the car and tries to use the memory function, it does not work. After he has set everything, my setting does does work properly when I get in the car. Not sure if we are doing something wrong.
It really is too small and is difficult to close even just with the manual in it. We can't store anything else in it.
Apple Car Play will not integrate with Waze for navigation; often experience pauses and garbling in the music due to signal issues between phone and car, even with the phone on the car's wireless charging pad.
seat does not return to original setting   also mirrors the same
In regard to the front cigarette lighter in the center console by the cupholders: my phone charger stopped working, I thought it was the charger. Then my small vacuum that works when plugged into the lighter wouldn't work.  I plugged both items into the rear lighter and both worked without issue. Have had the car 3 months and noticed that it stopped working about 2 months in. When I go for an oil change will be reporting and having it serviced.
It is not intuitive or easy to set the controls to the key for the driver's settings. The dealer genius briefly explained it but when I got home couldn't figure it out and didn't have time to read through the manual and deal with finding out how to set it up.
Control in a 'non-intuitive spot'
SPECIFICALLY ASKED ABOUT TEXT READING and receiving. TOLD Yes it has it. Once the papers were signed I found out that only certain configurations have it and they 'limit' blue tooth ability. For some reason BMW decided to limit Bluetooth functionality so you have to purchase more options. HOWEVER the car can not be upgraded. This cheapens the entire experience. Dealership and BMW unsupportive.
This car is way too loud for a $60,000 automobile. Comparable Volvo models are MUCH quieter.
Too much wind noise.
The heated9 steering wheel in my 2006 3-series seemed to get hotter..this one is too mildly warm
I have the oyster interior and it appears that dyes from pants and rubbing off regularly...would have hope seats would resist that
When I set the heat to a high temperature it will blow the hot air as desired but then it will switch to a very cool, like to cool down, and the reheat later and continue to blow.  Fan speed does not ch age, just the temp
Does not recognize my iPhone.  Happens infrequently and is easy to reconnect, so I have not had this problem serviced.
self parking is hard to do
: NOISE REAR SEAT
I have not had time to take my car in to BMW to have back speakers checked.
Monitoring system indicates that the pressures are low even when the media panel has pressures well above the correct pressure levels indicated in both the owner's manual and on the sticker inside the driver's side door. Also indicates tires are too low even when the pressure is higher than another tire on the monitor screen with a lower pressure.
The dash indicator shows the LDW is on, but it never vibrates. I changed the factory Medium setting to Strong vibrate, but that didn't help. : Difficulty getting the Bluetooth to play music from my iPhone; difficulty with the lane departure warning 
Not much to say. It started off brilliantly, and then started to have higher error rates. It's probably 50-50 right now in terms of accuracy.
The phone part works fine. The issue is in getting the car to play music from my iPhone and to play podcasts. It either doesn't work or is too complicated for me to figure out. : Difficulty getting the Bluetooth to play music from my iPhone; difficulty with the lane departure warning 
The seat belt rewtracts
Strange noise that of course when I took it to the dealer was unable to replicate. The noise is back again I just have to find the time to drop the car back off.
I think the road noise is a byproduct of BMW removing much of the insulation on this car in order to save weight

I understand that this is just to be expected with the higher quality brakes on the M2





: During snow and extreme cold, the car shook like steering was out of alignment.  Almost undriveable.  Contacted BMW, they said it was likely the cold and compacted snow under car impacting tires:suspension.   It subsided after a thaw.  Also mixed performance tires terrible in snow.   Was not discussed at time of purchase.  Option presented was ridiculously expensive - wanted to sell me wheels and tires.

The automatic  cut off engine function is irritating
I beleive the vehicle is design to have the load throaty engine sound.
The touch sensing door lock takes too long to activate.  Should be about 1/2 a second once touch.
The whole center console computer system is too complicated.  I can't figure out how to just display the clock in the center of the screen.  It only comes up as a split screen with navigation map.  The complicated computer system is annoying and I'm a fairly tech savvy person.
The ignition button has two modes. It's extra complexity that's not needed.  Also, when you turn off the engine, you have to press the ignition button once to tuen off the engine and another time to turn off the radio/display.
it smells worst after leaving the car out in the sun.  Could be the upholstery.
When the engine is turned on cold in the morning, it idles just a slightly bit rough. Not sure if this is an intentional design. it goes away after it's warmed.
See previous comment/complaint about Media. This is involved too.
I cannot enter a command for a system function unless I am in that function; for example, if I am currently using the media and it is the most prominent service on my screen, I cannot give a voice command to enter an address in the navigation system. I have to open navigation and then give the address. Seems like I should be able to tell it what I want and it will switch itself.
This is the only thing about BMW that I hate. It's system for switching between media services is horrible. If am on listening to the radio, the system will spontaneously switch to Pandora and then start playing the first song that starts with an 'A' on my iMusic playlist. I cannot stand that song now. It always wants to default to Apple iMusic. If I actually try to switch to Pandora, I have to fight the system to keep it from playing iMusic It usually takes multiple tries and, now, with the current system that will not let me make changes in Pandora on my phone, but forces me to use the BMW system, it is virtually impossible to do anything with it until I stop. This system is a total failure and is very similar to the system in my BMW M5 that I owned previously - meaning, this system is bad and has been bad for numerous generations of vehicles. Something has to be done. My wife drives a new  Cadillac Escalade and its system is an absolute dream! BMW must fix this!

the head up display completely disappears when i wear polarized sunglasses which is utterly idiotic since polarized sunglasses are very commonly used.  How on earth could a company as large as BMW completely miss or ignore this???




Absolutely THE WORST nav system i have ever encountered - anywhere.  It's inaccurate, doesn't find addresses of well established, long standing public and private locations, gives completely inaccurate directions causing me to get lost, is difficult to save or edit location entries, often impossible to complete actions that are extremely easy to complete on other nav systems.



Rain sensor does not respond to changing conditions fast enough.  I would prefer manual control over wipe intervals.
I brought my vehicle back to the dealership, and they were able to take care of the check engine light issue.I was told that it was the software issue - it was updated and ever since then, I didn't get the check engine light so far.It happened twice so... I am keeping an eye out.
opens partially unless continue to hold latch down
to many steps to find tire pressure
much rather have mirrors turn in automatically when car is locked
Dealer rep. seems to know less that owner
to keep manual in the box need to position it just right
Do I even have a parking break
As stated above. Took to dealer for adjustment. It wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t done
The routes nav chooses make no sense
I want to be able to remove it. I have been unsuccessful.

Occasionally the headlights and taillights will stay on all night long.
Experienced double vision at night. Mirror replaced.
Difficult to engage. Doesn't recognize parking spot fast enough and also has to correct too many times going forward and backward several times.

Bottom of front and rear doors don't align. I've taken this in, but it still isn't perfect.
Putting luggage on rear compartment cover dented and damaged immediately. Protrusion is luggage dug into it.
This is not NOISE per se, but the car does seem to wiggle left and right upon windy conditions.
It takes a pretty strong effort to make the horn beep. Maybe by design, but still not easy to operate.
This is a small thing, but wearing sunglasses , makes the display almost not visible. Polarized ones especially.
There is a little netting on the side of the cargo area. The hinge popped out and I have not been able to realign it since.

Light color seat stains easily with dark wash jeans/pants
I can't seem to find the feature on changing the time :-: recently with the time change
Brakes squeak very loudly just prior to vehicle coming to a complete stop.  Less than 5 MPH.  I called dealer and they said it is normal, but this is much worse than I have experienced on other vehicles.  When driving in traffic, people often turn their heads to look.   I plan to address on my first service visit. I have had many Bmws, Porsches, Audis and Mercedes and this is worse than normal.
Back up camera fails to show a picture every third or fourth time used.  Radar and park assist lines show up but image is black. When I restart the car the camera typically works again for a while.
The apps for Tune-in radio, Amazon music and others do not work properly.  They continuously disconnect or system starts streaming and then defaults to iTunes.  I upgraded to Apple Carplay and I am still having similar issues.  System is very touchy and does not allow reliable streaming.
the center of the front panel  instead of on a door you have to lean into the car to hit the unlock button to get to the back seat : It is not a problem as much as an inconvenience - the door lock is located in a poor location on the center of the dashboard panel.
it just does not matter what temp you set it at it will not cool enough
it really does not appear to cool very well.  worried about an Arizona summer
it really does not cool well
to smal,l does not cover the floor properly, with snow or wetness it leaves white water and snow residue ont he carpet, looks bad

I have only tried to use the USB port a couple of times and it so far has failed to read the devices I have used .


There is a 'clicking' noise when the engine is running.

Complaints are system design faults, not defective equipment
When the car is in the economy drive mode, the steering wheel sometimes locks or is nonresponsive.  When I put the vehicle back into comfort mode it works.
: The audio does not synch well with the iphone music

Hard to shut with owners manual




: The driver's seat doesn't raise high enough.
The center of the steering wheel - not the outer wheel itself - obstructs the view of the gauges in the center bottom of the display. I need to raise the seat to see over this part of the wheel, but then, the seat is not  at a comfortable level. I am 5'5' tall.
Seat belt clip is tight to center console and low - difficult to find if you are in a coat. Broke nail - ladies unhappy with this.
It is hot in AZ and we drink large drinks. Tall drinks from fast food businesses or Quick Mart, for example barely fit and are difficult to put in and get out - the cap rubs on the dashboard which slants over the cup. The cap may damage the dashboard in the future. Tall water bottles also fit on a slant.
Some features that worked when I drove off the lot mysteriously disappeared within a week. The dealership tried to say they never were there. My friends and I are well aware of what we saw. Maybe they weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t supposed to be available and they shut them down. Maybe it was an anomaly.


When I ask to call different people the voice command is not always recognized
Set too far forward. I drink a lot of water so use a large reusable water bottles and they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fit. In addition a 32oz cup sits too high and rubs against instrument panel
Hands free open feature is difficult to operate
: The trunk opened unexpectedly while the vehicle was running, but in park.

Location and/ or street is not at the right place.........  will take me the longer route even though requested fastest
Ink from pants is already starting to showe on seat
: Engine noise seems excessive at idle
They are awkward to use because they don't adjust at all and are narrow. They look cool but are kind of useless. I am still trying to figure out the best way to get in and out of the car and determine how they were intended to use.
Nav system doesn't always understand what i am saying
If you don't position your hand in the exact spot to pull the sun visor down its hard to pull down and the mirror is tiny - just not what I would expect from BMW
: bad pairing experiences with other devices  no text messaging service operating; bad AM radio receiption
balky system, fails 20% of the time; speaker very poor quality; drops calls constantly : bad pairing experiences with other devices  no text messaging service operating; bad AM radio receiption
routing info almost always off ; traffic info invariably wrong ; points of interest feature has always been worse than worthless:  a waste of time and dangerous to operate
no insight into how they are supposed to operate
don't know where they are; have difficulty whenever I try to locate
don't even know I have power operated headrest controls; don't know how to operate and have had problems with the manual controls on other BMW's
don't even know if I have ventilated seats, nor do I know how to activate
don't know how they operate
your defog device is crap

going over bumps at highway speeds, engine cuts out:  common on of my X5 diesels; took problem 3 cars ago, could not fix; have accepted this is an x5 design flaw. no current plan to seek repair
: The car has 'gesture control' but I can't figure out how it works.  I could likely go and learn but haven't bothered yet.
The front area has a lid that is either fully open or closed but can't be half open.  Its just a slightly odd size for phones, and too slippery on top to lay down your phone when closed.  The phone slot is behind the cup holders so it can be tough to get the phone out if you have a cup in.  Feels like it could be just a little bit better.
the cup holders in the center console are just a little too tight for my shaker bottle.  It fits but just barely.  My water bottle won't fit.
No satellite radio activated by BMW even though the car came with installed satellite radio and one year subscription
there are two phones paired with the Apple car play. It will not detect the correct phone unless you go to setting and manually switch to driver # 2. When driver # is in the car and Driver #2 is in it as well. Only connect the driver # 1 via Apple car play.
: After call display will not go back to radio, keeps going back to I-phone, voice activation command not understand
 : After call display will not go back to radio, keeps going back to I-phone, voice activation command not understand
: Rear camera stop working, tailgate no-touch not working, car turning on after its been turned off, lights not turning off, engine light coming on have to manually turn of car and lights : took car in to dealer, to show them that there's a problem engine light is on. scheduled appointment to bring car back in engine light was off
Previously responded to this : Tail pipe vibration
Just a bit too small
It feels as if the cup holders are a little too close to the controls. it is only a little difficult to get cups in and out, hardly worth mentioning.  If I were to have a large drink I'm not sure it would fit

The single unlock/lock button is in the middle of the dashboard. This should be conveniently located at the doors, such that when you open the door, you could be unlocking/locking all doors. However, if you are out of the vehicle, you need to lean inside the car to press the button. Also, my 2018 BMW does not allow to program the locks such that the doors are unlocked when you parked the car and turned off the ignition.
The directions provided by the Navigation System is not the best. Typically, I compare the navigation directions with those provided by Google Maps  and I always end up following google maps.
The auto shut down randomly stops working





the radio hasn't bad quality to listen to anything, I am tired to listen to the radio.
: the audio hasn't good quality to listen, and not easy connect your personal phone music.
 : the audio hasn't good quality to listen, and not easy connect your personal phone music.
my phone has Pandora there, when I start my car then try to use Pandora to listen to music, the connection doesn't work. It's difficult to let me enjoy the music when I driving.

when a/c is on, you stop/go, the engine goes to slowly

when I got this car first month, I forgot the turn off the lights, then the car battery went to very low, and have lights on of the battery on the screen.
Panel popped out
 : just poor reception...

vibrates when switching lanes and pulls.
Only over speed bumps , I am a technician for bmw have yet to look into problem because it is a race car and race car makes noises.
It's just sometimes difficult to place drinks in the cup holders because it's too close to the controls.
Backup camera would not turn on at least 10 tones before software update/reset at BMW
Speakers - all audio stopped working for 3 days until a software update/reset performed at BMW
It doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t recognize or misinterprets place names.
Dealer attempted to fix/hide the ding. It was pointed out to me by a detailer at a later point, including evidence of attempted fix.
Dealer did poor job at cleaning the car, causing swirls in the paint. Ended up going to a professional car detailer to have it properly cleared up.
Seems like a lubrication issue. Changing seat position makes the problem go away. Comes back on occasion.
Seems to be coming from the window assembly.
The handle for the glove compartment is made up of several plastic pieces that creak and rattle. Ended up putting a large rubber-band around the thing to make it stop. The glove box itself makes some noise after being opened and closed, while driving. Eventually seems to settle and keep quiet.
Minor rattle, but annoying when it happens. Haven't been able to identify exact spot, but kept the console empty.
When very cold outside, multiple passengers, must always have defrost on.
The top of the dashboard closest to the window, about a 2' strip, is not secured completely to the top of the dashboard.
A creak/rattle from the removable top cargo cover. This is extremely annoying.
: The headlights were not aligned properly  and upon bringing back to dealership still aligned improperly.  On next visit hopefully they will repair.
Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it to work reliably w my foot



: Seat memory button on left  number 1 stuck in during cold weather.  Fine now
The vehicle has an overwhelming amount of road noise.  The dealer advised they are aware of the concern and discussed the issue during the test drive.  I believe the road noise is germane to the X1, as it was explained to me, by the dealer.


: Keys do not retain individual  seat memory.  Remote often unintentionally opens tailgate.  Start/stop button works differently than on all other BMW's , not a good design change.  Console buttons, the least used button,  is the largest button, the largest button should be the most used.   Parking Brake and Auto High buttons are easily activated when getting into the car with a purse.  The set up with the 'I Drive' is incredibly complex and difficult to use,  for example, to change balance on radio, it takes many steps. Way too many options and choices - very distractive to the driver who should be watching the road.  All these problems are a daily headache and ones we never experience with our three previous BMW's other than the 'I Drive', which was always a problem.
Remote does not retain information for each individual driver.  Tailgate opens unintentionly very sensitive in pocket or purse. : Keys do not retain individual  seat memory.

Way too much information in such a small space.
In our three previous BMW's and apparently in all other 2018 BMW's the method to shut off the car completely was to press the Start/Stop button twice.  This new X3 in order to shut off the car completely - you press the Start/Stop once and open all doors of occupied seats or press the Start/Stop button once and hold the radio button until everything shuts off.  Really the radio shuts off the car - who designs these things?
 : Heated steering wheel did not heat.
I do not understand why my $150 Garmin can tell me the speed limit, but my $50,000 BMW can't!  I think knowing the speed limit is more important to know than where is the nearest Starbucks!
Seat seems slow to heat.
: One of our keys does not remember seat position.


When you're driving the car constantly pulls to the right.  I had the sme issue with my last BMW.
Many times will not pick up phone and connect to media.  WIll connect to telephone but not media.  Often have to turn blutooth off and use AUX

cup holder too small, cannot increase size
control nob is broken
overall the care can be loud especially when windows are down.

once I release the emergency brake the breaks will sound.
: The driver's side seat heat/ventilation is intermittent.  Does not consistently turn on when button selected.  Cannot determine the cause.

light comes on but seems like more warning would be necessary-beep -
have light tan color and the drivers seat has already discolored bluish tint in only 3 months use
On certain road surfaces , the vibration noise is so intense you cannot talk on handsfree calls or you end up talking louder so passenger can hear you speak.  There is also off and on squeaks where rear window and front windows meet.
The Apple Car Play feature is a nice feature, but if you cannot move flawlessly between non-apple car play feature and apple car play features.  For example if you are listening to a VM or listening to playlist, and go back to car radio sometimes you cannot go back to apple car play; the system does not connect even tho the phone shows it's connected.
Rattling of where rear and front side windows meet.
Gives me pairing notice on my phone repeatedly if the Wifi is not on ..........very annoying
The feature that allows opening of the trunk by moving a foot quickly forward and back underneath the back end of the car does not work as well or as often as it should.
The problem may very well be that I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand something, but 10 presets are easily usable, but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know of a way to switch Easley to a second 10 or third 10 presets without going through the menus which I find to be slow.
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a bit too close to the dashboard when inserting a large cup.
Road/engine noise seems to come through ventilation system
TPM light turned on shortly after delivery.   I took it to dealership to look at.
I think the run flat tires go flat way too easily which is both a problem in my area which has a lot of pot holes and dirt roads and is very expensive to replace!
If I want to change the route settings or look at what route it's selected is difficult to understand.  I need to get with a specialist to assist
I thought it was just the new car smell at first, but It just is an unpleasant odor that I had hoped would go away, but it has not
: Automatic trunk release  very difficult to activate.
The internal door handles makes it hard to close shut on the first try.  Frequently I have to open and use force to close.
Some period when accelerating from 20mph and higher I can notice additional vibration on the steering wheel.
Don't properly hold bottles
Tps says broken and dealer said it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s my fault within 1 week
Camera sometimes says malfunction and I have to restart the car to get it to work




Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t always recognize frequently used voice command and calls wrong person

: The passenger side mirror snapped close just like that and the plastic behind the mirror cracked.
Have to really slam the hood to close it. Otherwise only one side will latch
Trunk needs to be slammed hard to close properly otherwise it pops back open
Headlights while led are not bright during rain conditions
Display constantly resets Iran position to wherever it wants
sometimes difficult to adjust the front/back movement
It is difficult to manually adjust the seat and second row seat does not lock properly. i get the warning that second row seat not locked. You need to really hard hit to make it locked.
The Key Button for the Trunk Release is to sensitive and opens when not required.
The fuel door must be opened from the interior and exterior of the vehicle. Must Depress the fuel door several times before the door opens.
A main avenue in San Francisco has not allowed left turns for over a year; Google maps reflects this, but the BMW system does not. It frequently gives directions that take much longer than directions from Google Maps. I always check Google against the BMW system to make sure I'm not sent by BMW on a longer than necessary drive.



 : No problem with interior except glove box small
it's the run flat tires.  they produce a loud and hard ride compared to standard steel belted radial tires.  i hate them.  very poor decision by BMW to make them mandatory.
they have not worked well on my last three 7-series BMW.
When I sit in the center of the seat the wheel is slightly left of center.
The brakes grind all the time. Especially during the first drive of the day when I am backing out of my driveway. I also hear them when I am driving at minimal speed ad I am slowing down to stop. They are very noisy and I think they should brake better when I am stopping. They seem to give way to a slow roll instead of completely stopping
They seem to roll longer than necessary instead of stopping. I do not like to press all the way down on the brakes to stop and they need that extra force to stop correctly.
he sensors are very sensitive. Even when the car is over 10 feet away, the sensors will sometimes go off until the I move the car.
The people I am talking to through the Bluetooth cannot understand or hear me.
The bluetooth drops my connectivity sometimes and I have to pair it again.
Sometime it cools sometimes not --- just haven't needed AC much so haven't pulled out the book
: I can't receive 'sound/chime' notifications of an incoming text and email.
Only periodically
Blue jean color tends to rub off very easily on the light tan material as well as general scuff marks showing up easily
the positions don't always set to profile based on key



It just feels like you have to push harder than normal. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s different with our 5 series BMW
: Audio goes out for music connected by Bluetooth and even phone calls.
Paint had fine, cobweb-like micro scratches in clear coat likely from pre-delivery detailing with dirty/contaminated cleaning rags.


Mirror is broken
small button and hidden
Seems like it just took a little longer to get the brakes settled in and they made noise.
Cup holder isn't big enough for a variety of cups.  You have to use a specific size.
Hard to actually get fully closed

i cannot get the system to work well for me...might be me

was not explained well enough
: seat does not remember to move up when you lift handle
grease to lubricate the window mechanism
Hood was severely mis-aligned and wouldnt open of close easily.
Warning lights on screen indicated an issue with the four wheel drive system. Car was difficult to steer whenever this warning came up. Message recommended driving to the dealer for service
Steering wheel was tilted to the left as I would drive straight
Restraint system malfunctioned.
Restraint system malfunctioned
AC malfunctioned and would not cool at all, making a loud hissing noise
It's difficult to apply the brakes without having part of my foot on the gas. At times, I often have to roll my foot to the left to maintain more pressure on the brakes than the gas.

I reside in WV  and i cant clearly get any DC stations until i cross into the Virginia border.



Auto windshield wipers are difficult to make swipe slow enough in some fog or mist conditions. Everything is working as bmw intended, I just think the slowest mode is too fast
You seem to need to push the off button twice. Once for the engine, once for the electronics.  This is working as bmw intended, but I think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s strange. Dealer told me this is how it is
I bought apple car play. That was a mistake. If you activate this, all bmw interface is lost. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s one or the other. So, I disconnected apple car play. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still supposed to be able to text via the steering wheel button. This sometimes works, but mostly no.  Also, music from my phone is to play. It only wants to play Coldplay. NO matter which song I select.  Annoying. I like Coldplay, but have other songs too.  The bmw genius wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that smart
Taller cups or mugs interfere with the center console


Whenever it rains, the rain accumulates inside the door panels and on the back of the truck. This makes the truck looks bad also the water gets on your pants or legs getting in and out of the truck. I am not sure if the doors need to be sealed more or if the inside of the door should have be made a little more slanted so that the water runs off. I don't know if there needs to be running boards added to see if this helps.
Vehicle will default to apple car play, if listening to another source and a call or text message comes in the vehicle, instead of returning to the audio source that it was on prior to the call/text, will go to apple car play...
There isn't a way, other than synchronizing all zones, to control the rear seat temperature from the front.
vehicle will not heat up efficiently when driven in BMW's ECO pro mode. which is pretty stupid.
fan blows tepidly at best.
I have an intermittent squeak I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t figure out.
Latch wasn't attaching.  Had to take vehicle to be serviced within the first month.
As stated wrong location presented as destination,
At times the rear hatch will not close when I use the remote or the button in drivers area.  I have had to get out o fcar and push button on hatch door.
Problem is that phone does not connect to Apple CarPlay at times.  To fix this, I've disabled and re-enabled CarPlay.  Other CarPlay issue is that when I use Waze app, the system will switch from one source  to the CarpPlay home screen.  This occurs when Waze try to connect to car to make announcement like 'Pothole reported  ahead.'I had to delete the Apple Music app to stop the system from constantly switching to it.  I don't use Apple Music.  Maybe more of a CarPlay issue than BMW...not sure.
I feel like the brakes don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t respond right away when going at higher speeds on the high way
Not straight forward to use. Usually takes longer route. I usually use my cell phone/ google maps because of this : The display screen is a bit too small
The hybrid has an electric lock unlike any other BMWs I have ever had, and you have to press a button to the left/below steering column. Not a fan of this, and it did not open one time. Was able to force it open and it has not given me any issues since. Not sure why this car has that feature now as the door locks when you lock the car... took to Union Park BMW and they checked it out and could not replicate the issue, we discussed and they told me to let them know if it happens again.
Previous BMWs I have owned, the navigation background color was either black , green , or greyscale . This 2018 has what looks like a white over off white color for background and road colors... very tough to see if it is bright out. Not a fan of this at all.
Widow directly in front of driver does not clear when fogged up because heads-up display does not allow room for direct venting.

vehicle location for home adress is inaccurate
Memory 1 and memory 2 set for two different drivers. Did not retain settings. Gave up trying to reprogram.
The engine shuts off too early when coming to a stop, resulting in a mild jerk when coming to a full stop.
The car has a TPMS system error that has been worked on by the dealership 3 times and they haven't been able to fix it.
I noticed when I washed my car last month,  the paint looks spoty. : the running boards look spotty
It's just confusing on how to put it in park
The tailgate will pop open slightly, but not open fully.  This does not occur every time, but it is frequent.

the display needs to be higher on the windshield

: Doesn't maintain radio stations between cranks

Items placed in the door storage fall to the bottom and can not be reached while driving. example cell phone, sun glasses etc. this is a design flaw.
The winter floor mats do not protect the floor rugs from white salt staining. they need to be a bit higher on all sides. This is a design problem, andmay only be associated with winter climates were salt is used on the roads.
There is no latch on the back, nor does the swipe your foot under the trunk method 'hands free' works
: The tire dust flap was installed incorrectly causing a friction sound while driving.
No
The battery light was on when I purchased the vehicle.
It's just hard to operate
Can't  seem to be able to set it up
Happens each time I open the sun roof, but is getting better with each use.
Only happened once, but the third week into driving the car, after I pumped my gas, I tried closing the fuel door and some kind of clasp would not allow me to close it. I spent 20 mins at the gas station trying to fix it, without trying to break anything by jamming it too hard. I think I was able to close it by messing around with a small clasp near the door & I haven't had an issue since.
It doesn't interpret my voice commands. For example, when I want to navigate to certain stores nearby, I state the store and it won't recognize it. Otherwise, I state I want a gas station on the way home and it won't understand.
I have to play with getting the charging door to open.  It can open first time, or take me several times to open
Started hearing the rattle after the tire was replaced after a month

This a X3 M40i but the wrong steering wheel was installed as the M3 steering week was not available. I am waiting for steering weel replacement with proper M3 steering weel. I took problem to dealer but not sure the status on the situation. I need to follow up with dealer.
Need to touch a command to get voice reconnection system works and need to be in certain part of the menu to be able to get voice command work. It is too limited. This a design problem not the car.
Took nearly 3 weeks to fix this problem. Did not get any compensation for this. Sadly could not drive my new car.
Carplay support is poor
carplay is poor

Too smal to block sun.
The problem itself does not happen all the time but once in a while, the phone wont sense the phone and automatically connect.

Seatbelt mount to interior car wall is too high, and can not be adjusted down to better fit someone who is shorter height. This makes it uncomfortable in the driver's seat.
Black shadow trim that goes over door and connects to door panel along the back side is loose.
At the right light/angle you see streaks in the paint.
the auto rain sensor often triggers by mistake without any rain/water on the windshield which often smears whatever road grime is on the windshield at that time. 
Dimming feature is only for about 90 percent of the mirror. About a quarter inch around the perimeter of the mirror is non-dimming leaving for annoying glare from vehicles behind you.
Dimming feature is only for about 90 percent of the mirror. About a quarter inch around the perimeter of the mirror is non-dimming leaving for annoying glare from vehicles behind you.
Sensory Overload.... Too much on the screen which ultimately impedes the view of the camera.
Systems often mistakes non-parking spots as parking spots. Also too many steps involved with the final step requiring that you hold a button down in the console to make the vehicle move. If the button was to get that kind of usage, it should be of better quality . In some cases the vehicle gets uncomfortably close.
: Once done using voice commands and once the command is executed, the screen should go back to navigation AND the audio/music should resume. This does not occur. While primarily a software issue, it will still require intervention by BMW.
Where the bottom seat cushion meets the rear cushion of the drivers side seat, the padding underneath seems to be lacking  making the leather upholstery loose.
Rattle to the left side of the steering column, Very difficult to diagnose cause.
Auto Shutdown feature cannot be disabled for commuters in constant stop and go traffic. You must disable it manually, after every start of the vehicle. BMW notes that this is an 'Enhancement' to the previous auto shutdown/restart feature.
: I am not excessively tall , but the height of the hatch when fully open is so low that I keep whacking my head on it. It's much lower than my x3 was.
I hate the way they changed the 'automatic' operation so it's in line with the wand between intermittent and continuous. Now it's impossible to get an additional wipe of the blades without turning off automatic mode. Very poor redesign choice.
I use the one in the back because the one in the front is basically inacessible
It's only when the front defrost is on

The front cup holders only fit small bottles and drinks, and they are really crunched for space
Kind of a gross chemical smell after I picked it up. I put an air freshener in the car
Dealership replaced all 4 TPSM in order for brake light to go off after starting vehicle
See earlier comment about TPMS
Dealership replaced tank venting valve
: Sometimes the tailgate does not open all the way
Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see it to plug it in.

On several occasions, system has directed a turn in a direction opposite to what is plainly required. System recovers if the improper direction is ignored.

there is constant adjustment to get the seat in a modestly comfortable position.
the seat has never become comfortable.
not sure if the front defrost is working properly. takes a very long time to defrost the window in cold weather.
it is too loud. I cannot hear the radio
the car stopped and didn't restart.

The gauge panel glass has condensation on the inside
: Heated steering wheel gets too hot during each use and has to be turned off once steering wheel is warmAutomatic windshield wipers are not as effective as previous design - do not sense rain as good and therefore do not work as effectively Parking assist engages too easily/not at appropriate times 
: Heated steering wheel gets too hot during each use and has to be turned off once steering wheel is warmAutomatic windshield wipers are not as effective as previous design - do not sense rain as good and therefore do not work as effectively Parking assist engages too easily/not at appropriate times 
Not intuitive how to adjust

Fuel Consumption could higher for the size of vehicle. Technology has improved for years.


Periodic connection problem.  After 2 months I was able to track the problem to the BMW app on my iphone.  Once I deleted BMW's own app, things have worked much better!!
Appointment with dealer is scheduled for diagnosis.

Doesn't respond correctly to voice commands for navigation. Easier to do manually.
: The tires deflated, but that might be from a nail.


i immediately called the dealer and had difficulty reaching the right person. When I finally reached the correct person, health issues prevent me from bringing the car in to the dealer, so I had to cancel the appointment.
There is no motion sensor on the trunk to open the trunk.  The  only way to open the trunk  is to use the key fob button -- this is very inconvenient when you have bags of groceries in your hands.  There should be a motion sensor on the vehicle to open the trunk -- just like there is on the door handles. Other BMW series like the 3 & 4 have this--why doesn't the 2 series have it??
The clock is partially obstructed by other items on the dash board - plus the clock, shown in two places -- is VERY small.  I am used to a much larger clock on the dash that is easier to see. I don't like this feature on the BMW at all.  We should be able to have a large clock display if we want it.
The seat belt buckle has to reach into the the piece that it snaps into -- that piece is so so far back into the seat that you have a lot of difficulty reaching it in order to buckle it.  The piece is also very low into the seat.  The positioning of the seat belt buckle piece on the side of the seat is very difficult to get to and very difficult to maneuver in order to snap/engage the seat belt.  It clearly is not designed properly.
Noise on uneven pavement
outside trunk release will work intermittently when car locked when key is in my pocket.  Approx 1/3 of the time I have to take the key fob out of my pocket and hold it up to the trunk to get it to release.  Very annoying and inconvenient.
difficult to scroll to proper location on screen to figure out the current psi
truck latch works intermittently when car locked.  Sometimes trunk will open when I execute latch.  Othertimes not.  I have to take the key out of my pocket and hold it next to the trunk to allow it to open.  It will always happen when I have numerous things to carry and it is difficult to take my key out to get trunk to open.  It will never happen when I show it to the BMW repair person, who then informs me it can't be fixed if the problem can't be observed.
rear collision alert is sporadic, sometimes it will warn me with an audible sound, othertimes no.  My prior Lexus ALWAYS alerted me of cross-traffic.  Not so with this vehicle.  Not reliable.
'recaro' type seats can be uncomfortable at sides of seat where it tilts up
 : This seems to happen during acceleration but very intermittent
: Entertainment center rebooted randomly a couple of times a couple of months ago.  Not sure why.

Seems to take longer than it should to get to set temperature.  Much longer than my other vehicles



Not sure exactly where it is coming from.  There are creaks around doors, dash and mirror
Discovered this and told I had to buy a NEW TIRE ... I was not happy about this.  I was told I must have hit something ... HOWEVER, I did not hit anything and I am the only driver of this vehicle.
There is NO audible warning for collision ... a red car indicator isn't positioned to be helpful.  No audible warning when backing up ... just lights which are difficult to understand.
VISOR doesn't block the sun ... need to be bigger.  Speed Warning notification does not stay set, goes back and consequently never works.  The storage in the vehicle is not satisfactory, seems like a better job could have been done using the interior space.  the center console is an example .. it doesn't hold much of anything.  The back up warning DOES NOT HAVE sound ... neither does the FRONT COLLISION warning ... difficult to see when having your eyes on the road ... it needs to have an audible warning sound.  These are design features I believe that the dealer cannot fix, except for the speed warning, which they handed off to BMW International. : The SPEED WARNING notification does not work and STILL does not work.  I picked car up in December this is now April.  I was told it is a problem with the software.  I am VERY disappointed that my vehicle does not have an ANDROID connection for text messages etc.  THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM for ME AND A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.
: Not sure this is what you are looking for ... but to me this is a driving problem ... the VISOR does not block the sun.  There needs to be some kind of extension that would pull down to make the visor wider at the very least. : VISOR doesn't block the sun ... need to be bigger.

Some of the pixels in the speedometer were not working. This was covered under the warranty. A replacement was quickly ordered for my car.
the cover is difficult to take out and then put back in.  You have to tilt it just right to get it into the place where it should sit.
I've complained about the tiny sun visor since my first i3 .  It does not help with blocking out the sun at all.  Its so small it is useless for anyone to try and use.  I've talked to our service advisor and he says there is nothing that can be done to correct this flaw.  I would have hoped you, BMW would have developed something better for the 2018 model.  This is my one and only disappointment with the i3 and this is going on 4 years of owning 2 different year models.
rear doors lock soon as you park.  have to unlock to get work bag out
too hard to find what things do in manual
too hot or too cold
auto H engaged.  went to park and light turned green
rides rough compared to my lexus
One of the cup holders offers too small a circumference for a typical refillable water bottle  to sit in ... to add to this, the height of the space where the cup holder is located allows for a short bottle and not a taller one.  The other cup holder is in the front door pocket and requires the bottle or drinking container to sit at an angle and almost horizontal position.  Below, I will select that the dealer did not resolve the issue as this is not an issue that may be resolved without returning the vehicle OR by my being more flexible in purchasing different drinking containers that will fit the space.  On a different note, I also answered a question above regarding the sun visor ... it does not hang low enough to block any significant amount of sun in my eyes.  I have my seat elevated as high as it will go, but the sun is often in my eyes since the visor is so short that it does not block enough sun.
I didn't realize you would ask me to comment on a different page so I explained my reasoning with this on the previous page.  I apologize for that but wanted to make sure that I was able to explain my selection regarding the sun visor question.
BMW replace the steering wheel under warranty.
I still have changed my clock because I cannot figure out how to do so. I am quite tech savvy but am stumped by this one!

favorite radio station  comes in clear in my other car  but not in the BMW when in similar locations around town
it only happened 1 time but my phone all of a sudden did not pair with the car after many weeks of doing so just fine.  I had to forget the car from my phone and re-pair.
I paid for the clear coating on my seats but instead of keeping the seats clean, dye from clothes transfers after a few times of sitting on the seat. The BMW dealership is looking into a solution. They have deep cleaned my driver seat once but the transfer has reoccurred after 3 weeks. Very disappointing.
Mechanism to bring seatbelt forward did not work at delivery
: Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know - light came on - took it to shop - they had it for 3 weeks



HUD is in the middle of the windshield in direct line of sight and can only be moved up and down.  I should be off to the side. So now I have a cool feature that I have to turn off so its not distracting to my driving.
Trim from control knob has fallen off
Engine occasionally does not shut down when stopped at traffic lights.  Have not taken in because its an intermittent issue and taking the care in if the problem is not present gets the we can't fix it we can't see the problem answer.
First gear is very jumpy in sports mode
I do not feel the heat in steering wheel
Slow lock to lock turning will create noise once vehicle returns to center.
In awkward location for efficient removal or placement of media device/phone.
Does not dial or phone requested person
Pairing with music service/ Amazon will go to phone call and will not sync back to Amazon service.
Will automatically sync to Pandora without request and disable use of music files forcing programming to go back to music files again.
Easily moved with passenger ingress and egress causes traction issues to get in and out of vehicle.


apple play does not work well at all

The leather marks extremely easily from drivers√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ and passengers√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ clothes.
Within the first month of delivery, I got three separate chips in the windshield. This has never happened on any other car I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve owned.
Fuel door opens itself when at car wash 
It is very difficult to make the horn to sound
Indicators are not easy to see, mostly during daytime
Collission avoidance not always shows when a car is present and closeI do not know if the car autobreaks if needed
Head up display seldom does not show up
I live in Florida an I had many cars.This car takes too long to cool down the cabin compared to all my previous ones
Rattle noise at the trunk area, maybe the gate
When turning the car on and backing out of the garage, the brakes make a high pitch squealing noise.  Took car to maintenance at BMW and the service rep heard the noise too! Said it is probably dust and will go away the longer I drive for the day.
: The rear hatch is supposed to open or close by putting a foot under the rear bumper in the middle.  I can seldom get this feature to open the hatch and occasionally the hatch will try to close on me if I am standing immediately behind the rear bumper in the middle.
Fun flat tires are very noisy 
Lately I have noticed few times that when I need to break faster than normally breaks are feeling very soft i.e. even breaking hard it does not feel as good as my earlier X5
WIth all safety features  I assumed it will have also adaptive cruise control.... but it have never worked so I assume it's not activated even though it should be using similar technologies...

Not able to find POI or street address sometimes. Car is not supporting Android Auto which is big disappoitment.
Seat cushion is not as supportive than my earlier BMW X5 had i.e. I tend to slide more easily while driving
For some reason the voice commands operate better with a male√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s voice.
Charge port door wont open
The turn by turn navigation in a big city like San Jose,CA downtown was inaccurate..kept on telling ne  to turn on non particular street
The motion sensor does not easily trigger -- nearly almost always fails to detect your foot.  This makes handless entry difficult.
Bluetooth Audio is erratic often losing connections with Pandora.  Also, Amazon Music is supposed to be a supported app but is not available within the BMW appstore.
The center console between the driver and passenger seat over-heated to the point that it melted gum in the storage areas and was hot to the touch.  BMW service could not determine root cause.  They suspected the rear vents were closed with the heat on.  For some odd reason, the vents are supposedly designed to vent into the closed console storage space resulting in excessive heat when the rear vents are run.  I imagine cold would result if the rear vents were on cold.  Stupid design.
Glove box is too small making the door hard to close -- especially with the driver's car manual inside.
The check engine light activated due to an alleged loose gas cap but reseating the cap did not solve the problem.  I had to take the car in to the dealer to have an engine sensor replaced within the first 2 weeks of ownership.


Difficult to understand
Difficult system. Doesn't work
Hard to reach on driver side
Difficult to clean
Diffficult to use
Small. Cheap
when the car is in reverse and the camera parking sensors are on the left side of the touchscreen and the camera section is on the right, the camera just does not turn on.
this is BMW's issue with Android compatibility. All of my friends who have iphone don't have these problems. I also feel shorted for mirror display.
I have the X1 sport edition and the tires that come on that edition are terrible in the winter.  I slip and slide all over the road.
: Takes a long time for the heat to warm the vehicle.
Tight fitting and do not hold a bigger cup/bottle
Please see above.  Also when I drop my phone between the center console and the driver's seat I cannot see it and it is very difficult and frustrating to find it. If you had a tray that the driver could place in their vehicle to catch the telephone, you would make many of your customers very happy, even if they had to buy this accessory themselves. I have the same problem in my other car, a 2016 528i.
Due to my height , the fact that the car is so low, and the fact that the car is two door  and I have limited range of motion due to a fused left ankle, it is very hard for me to exit the car without hitting the inside driver's side door panel with my shoes.
After a rain or wash, when the door is opened you can see the water on the inside of the door jam.  When the truck opens the waster running into a a catch area .
Sometimes the radio, dashlights, etc. don't turn off even after pressing the ignition off switch and opening the door multiple times. one might have to restart the car and go through the shutoff procedure again.
When backing up  slowly, especially in my daughter's driveway, but not exclusively, the car comes to an abrupt stop. This happens even though no vehicle or pedestrian is approaching from the side. : Sometimes, when backing up slowly, the vehicle stops automatically, even though there is no cross-traffic or pedestrian.
: Sometimes the vehicle answers the phone or makes a call, but the audio does not transfer to the car.
door handle will sometimes pinch skin on hand as it is being opened
way the handle is made, sometimes will pinch skin when opening the door
: tire pressure monitoring is super sensitive and so slow to reset
sometimes it just doesn't connect automatically; and Car-Play is sketchy
frequently have to put address in a different way, only to have it recognize the address the way it should've gone in ; sometimes you have to start with the zip code because the car has decided not to give you the entire alphabet to spell out the name of the city or town
Have emergency road service but wasn't hooked up correctly, told me I didn't have that service
not as much room as in the 2015 model-why change that?
Sun visor is made for tall persons only when in a super sun glare position, a short person has to keep a Hat with a visor in the car,; visor should be adjustable. Not everyone has a long torso even if they are tall. It should be as adjustable as a seat : the fact that the visors are basically useless, and I was asked 3 years ago about the space between the pedals and nothing changed in 3 years
I haven't regularly been able to find the spot where the motion sensor detects me
The light color leather is unforgiving and doesn't hide the dirt from regular use
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a shame that they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t use an electronic format for the parking brake to save space and make the console more comfortable for the driver
Feels cheap a step back in time wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t expect a manual leaver in a car in price range
Seems that it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t happen if I apply the brakes slowly and steadily, but that isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t always practical

When I srart the car it often brings up a destination that I have not requested and have never been to
It takes a lot of pull power to open the hood. It should not take superhuman power to release the hood.
must really slam it shut
Hand brake location difficult to reach for tall people.
Driver seat occasionally does not adjust to fob. : Driver seat does not always adjust to particular fob.

Not logical. Had to get explination as to filtered air, not filtered air, etc. Useless!!!
Keyless lock intermittent in cold weather
: Steering wheel gets too hot
Sometimes tailgate does not open automatically and I have to lift it
Discussed with BMW. ALGOITHM is horrible.
Right seatbelt rattles if not placed back flush
Trouble with Apple CarPlay.  If I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m listening to the radio, then I receive a call, after the call, the audio often defaults to the last Apple Music or podcast I listened to, not the radio that I was listening to before the call.
Does not always reset to new driver after a second driver using a separate key has driven.



It looks like glue just under the passenger side mirror. I noticed it when I washed it myself.
Instrument cluster was scratched on the inside. Manufacturer defect.
DIscolored.  Dealer replaced immediately.
: :Drivetrain failure message came on in 3rd month of ownership; car was towed to dealer; fuel injector seals replaced  weeks ago.  Waiting to see if problem recurrs
The directions given are through heavy traffic areas and not most direct to destination
: The AC does not cool well.
Repaired by dealer under warranty
There is poor contact between the rear window wiper blade and the glass - resulting in inadequate clearing of mist from the window


They feel weak compared to other cars. I have to push harder to brake.
Dont know where the buttons are
Limits cargo space after done correctly.
There is a whistling noise on the drivers side next to the window when i drive
controls are not easy to understand in terms of what inflates or deflates the lumbar support
Do not know how tp operate the memory controls

There are dividers which limit the ability to store item in the side pockets


Colors, graphics not appropriate colors or shade to see in bright light.

Noticed small scratch on door upon delivery.  Dealership mentioned nothing, but was willing to try and repair once I brought it to their attention. I chose not to have the dealership repair it believing they would make the small scratch look much worse with tampering. The dealership was not transparent during the purchasing process so my faith in their ability to handle the repair without incident was null.
Tire in question lost considerable air pressure, but seems to be holding the air now that it has been reinflated.  For new tires, it didn't seem appropriate to have this happen so soon after purchase.
Tan seats pick up significant color  due to driver sliding in and out of vehicle daily.


There isn't an icon shown on the dash when the heat is on. The light is in a poor location on the side of the sterring wheel and you can't see if it always on or off due to its poor location.
It seems that Google Maps with traffic on your Iphone is more accurate when it comes to traffic and destinations times. Also, changing alternate routes in the nav system can be cumbersome at times.
It seems the defrost setting can be quite loud. But it does clear the windows quite rapidly.
The automatic windshield wipers do not appropriately match the intensity of the precipitation.  I regularly switch to manual.
When I say commands, such as 'Call X' or 'navigate to Y' it often gets it wrong.
My phone usually connects, but sometimes it doesn't and I must connect manually.  Once it connects it automatically starts playing the same song from my iPhone music app every time.  Even when I try to play other applications It automatically tries to play this same song first once it is paired for some reason.
The navigation system is just difficult to use.  It takes too long to try and enter a location.  Sometimes the navigation systems fails to find an address while the navigation app on my iPhone has no issue identifying the location.  Once the navigation system is started it's difficult to end navigation and/or turn off the sound without also turning off music in the car.
: Every now and then the car will 'pop' out of gear back to neutral and I would reset it.  It only happened maybe 3-4 times over the first month.



rough ride
When in the car wash with car on auto hold, it won't go off.  the car wash tire catch kept slipping under the tire which probably is not good for axles
Specifically Rain Sense activation.  Requires move lever up 1 notch.  Hard to tell if engaged or not.  Preferred 535 method of engagement using a button and light indicator to confirm status
Floor mat rides on to gas pedal making difficult to control.  Should be locked/held into proper place.  Constantly having to adjust while driving.  Dangerous!
Just pulling out of garage, stumbles a few times at 3-4 mph and then fine
After less than 3500 miles got a low oil indication warning.  Took to a dealer and they topped it off.  Wonder if enough oil to start with.  Never happened on my 535

Brakes are very sensitive . I takes a very light foot to avoid jerking at the stop or slowing down.
dark interior make it difficult to see items
Once again black interior makes is difficult to see items.  Door compartments are so deep that items get lost.   Trade off for great capacity .
Black interior difficult to locate holders. holders are forward rather than close to seat.
Visors are too narrow.   do not extend down far enough for shorter people
The usb ports are located behind the  cup holders in the console, and if I plug in my phone there's no place to set it.
in general cup holders are too small for my travel water bottles and coffee mugs.  If I try to shove the bottle in, it invariably pops out while I'm driving.
when it is activated, it doesn't really seem to know what to do, or specifically where the car is or how it is positioned with regards to the parking space which makes it very difficult to use.
It comes off very easily but is impossible to keep in place.
Door feels like  refrigerator that has so many excessive air that it hard to close front door, one time was driving till the front door opened with out the warning light alarming before driving. : The driver door, unable to latch when closing. Needed to pull harder than usual. Look like a recall coming up

The key sometimes has to be pressed three times to unlock the side doors and rear hatch. I heard you can 'program' it but don't know how.
Keyless entry is difficult to program and I don't like having to hit the same button 3 times to unlock the back doors.

Sometimes the Nav system will give me directions that are not the best way to get from point a to point b.


Space used for other reachable items better to holders elsewhere
I have two dogs that I travel with. I still haven't figured out how to disarm the alarm system so the dogs don't set if off when I leave them in the car.
There are too many screens to go through to get to the information.

The switch to turn on the heated steering wheel is on the side of the steering column. The button lights up when the system is on, but it is impossible to see the light when driving. it is therefore hard to know if the heater is on or off.
Satellite radio was missing from menu on delivery. Repaired by dealer.
Memory seat button hidden between bottom seat cushion and door. Cannot be seen while sitting in seat.Easy to accidentally hit the 'set' button and reset the memory.
This supposedly has been fixed. See previous comments. : Water leaked through the roof piece and shorted out the emergency assistance program. We had to wait 31/2 weeks until it was repaired. We had the car 1 week after delivery.2nd problem - the driver√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s side, front and back ambiance door lighting does not work. At the dealership now!
Passengers have complained it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s difficult to buckle belt.

Not sure if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just the angle, but when positioning on drivers window it is hard to extend
My husband also drives my car and needs hand controls to do so.  With the new completely digital system, I have an emergency malfunction error due to the airbag around my legs being disabled and removed.  The code covers the odometer so I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what my mileage is.  The dealership was unable to fix it. : Disabled emergency speaker which causes an emergency malfunction code.  It hides the odometer as it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all digital and was unable to be cleared at the dealership.

I noticed that it was not brake well. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not sure what the issue was because the Road was not wet.
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been to the dealer yet.

Phone connects, but sometime there is no audio heard from car speakers. This is likely a problem with my phone though.
Tires make excessive noise


No spacr at all. Wireless charger ia too small to fit most phones.

Apple Car Play is glitch, randomly dials numbers, shifts from navigation to audio to other screens.
: Occasionally when I first turn on the car my center display will show that I am calling myself with my phone . However, no call is in progress on my phone and I did not initiate a call. The car will not let me simply hang up, so I have to grab my phone and call someone else briefly or do other things to end the call.
I'm guessing why this car makes so much road noise is because of the Michelin tires and how its cold out, also where i live the roads... not very nice. I'm sure in the summer these tires will make up for it.
in the middle of the consle where the radio stations,cd and climate control are. In between the cd and climate control the carbon fiber is sticking out a little bit. sometimes i hear it squeak and deffently when i press on to it but its no big deal to me still love the car :)
not very sure, first time driving the car the interior smelt a little funny but not from the air vents, can't explain what it smelt like but wasn't a problem to me.
I know its normal and doesn't bother me but i thought i should state what i think. but i think the transmition is awesome!

gps too many steps to control

I don't like how it sticks left accidentally when I'm just changing lanes. I would prefer a definite stop between lane change and turn signal.
small dent

: The garage door opener of the car will not accept my code for my house as we do not have the original door opener that came with the garage door opener.

Only first thing in the morning.  Then they are fine
It doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand me
It sometimes doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pair
its difficult to remember and conduct all the steps
Noise appears to come from the mirror attachment - its not on the hinge where I figured i'd find a squeak.  Issue occurs on open and close of the door.
Placement of the cup holder is in front of the gear shift and somewhat 'under' the overhang of the HVAC controls.  They sit high enough that anything taller than a soda can impedes the ability to use the HVAC controls.  Removal of some items then cause problems because you have to maneuver them out of the holder.  Very strange design.
It's no big deal, but the steering wheel will get warm pretty quickly but not does not maintain its temperature. It even cools down quite a bit.

light should be closer to driver to see better




Slightly out of alignment





Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pair multiple telephones at the same time.  Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pair iPod easily every time.

Fan does not stay off when you restart vehicle.  Fan automatically goes to max when push defrost.  Causing loud noise.

Automatically fan speed maxes out when turn on defrost, have to lower speed manually.  Also, as a result too noisy.
Engine was deemed defective and replaced. : Engine rattling noise when accelerating.
The trunk opener located below BMW logo sometime physically hard to use.
It is hard to use the way... ' move your foot from the bottom of the rear bumper and the trunk will open automatically ' Also, the trunk opener located below the BMW logo... sometime physically hard to use.
In Reverse... the rear camera did not come up with audible/visual sensors together frequently. Also, the iDrive shows CC msg Auto PDC malfunction many times.
My Navigation information will freeze on the Head-Up display . 
Gesture Control is hard to use. 
The iDrive monitor NAVI infos should be update  with my head-up display together. But they didn't.
poor fit
could be accent recognition issue.
seems the database is not up-to-date.
Seems the temperature setting is not accurate.  68F is warmer than it should.  66F feels colder.
Sometimes when using navigation it goes to my phone and will not give me voice commands for directions.

I use a 30Oz insulated Rtic and this will not fit into the cup holder due to size and location

: Satellite radio goes in and out at times.

Placing foot under the car to release trunk door is very difficult.   Most of the time the sensors don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work


the automatic close ability when slightly pushing the door from the outside to close seems to not work. I need to forcefully push the door close from the outside to engage the door to close properly.
I have difficulty getting the back hatch to open with the motion sensor.  Sometimes is works easily and other times I have to move my foot several times to get it to work.
Several rock chips on nose/front hood of car that have been 'touched up'  These were not noticeable when we looked at the car on the lot.  Also a rock chip/ding in passenger rear door
there is nothing to say except it does not work, has never worked since I drove it the first time I was told red light  comes on there has 'NEVER' been a showing of red light!!!!!!
I have a foreign accent
I compared the heat from the driver and passenger seats and find a big difference.  The driver seat gets barely warm. The passenger is as expected and what I am used to in other cars
My husband said this happened on new vehicles sometimes, I checked the tire pressure manually and reset the sensors from the console. Issue did not occur again


Slightly misaligned
Extremely visible after windows were tinted.
Camera software reset
Apple Car Play sometimes disconnects through bluetooth from iphone x. Needs to pair again after deleting the bmw from iphone x.
: Driver seat right plastic rail cover broke when seat was move back to clean carpet.
Brakes squeak only sometimes, not regularly.
Assuming they are high-performance brakes, it is natural that they create more dust.
handbrake DOES hold vehicle, but you have to pull excessively hard to engage it all the way. Otherwise, it doesn't.
central locking button is in an awkward position on center of dash.
Creaking coming from door seals, dealership said that was normal from seals getting dirty.
Car does not have a 'park' gear, car sometimes goes into manual mode on accident.
When the 'Drivelogic' is in level 3, shifts and clutch engagement can be rough.


Possibly sealing issue with door.  Sounds like air coming in/escaping.  Not loud, but like a quiet squeak sometimes.
VERY MINOR - one fin inside the vent is not properly aligned. I am assuming it will be a quick easy fix.  I could probably fix it myself, but it is not an urgent issue and does not cause me any inconvenience.  It does not impact the HVAC system's effectiveness.

No back-up beeper sound or I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t figure out how to turn on!
The back up camera is no longer showing the rear colored lines and doesn't beep when backing up close to something
the system says there's another Bluetooth operation in process when my phone is on but not being used. It will connect after about 5 minutes
: Trunk- foot opening does not always work.  Also would like to be able to close it with a switch or button.  I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like to manually close the trunk.  After shoulder surgery it was hard to reach.
I door locks in center of car on dash difficult to reach and inconvenient.  I can never located the sensor for the trunk opening system
Only has one USB port and it is located inside the arm rest. No line in port
I have to pair it about once a week
Too tall
Most of my insulated cups are tall for cold drinks and water. They do not fit under the dash control panel. I have to leave them crooked and leaned up against panel.
there was a mis match of the latches so the passenger side would not latch. I had to fix it myself.
the gap between the hood and the front sheet metel is excesively large compared to the rest of the body panels
Most of the car really is quieter then my 2013 X3 so the wind noise coming in the driver side door is very noticeable. The dealer is very far away several cities away from us so I try not to go to the dealer.
the location of the 'miles to go before being empty is poorly located AND AT NIGHT IS NOT READABLE. Why it is red at night is beyond me. I know when flying red is used to not interfear so much with night vision. it should be back where it was for the 2013 x3

I have a problem with navigating with the voice recognition but could be operator error.
: I am not able to pull the wipers out in the front to lift them up before it snows to prevent them from freezing and icing up.  Also can't lift them out to clean off any ice on them.
apple car play is a joke.  I have been to the dealer several times and each time they say its a problem with apple car play not bmw.  The connection works at then suddenly there is no connection.  I can only speak and hear anything while holding my phone. the blue tooth doesn't work. An incoming call will come in and ring and you can't connect to it unless you use the phone itself..  Also at times can't disconnect the call from the car have to do it on the phone itself..  This makes for very I repeat a very dangerous driving situation.  Each time I go to the dealer they have to delete my phone from the system and reload it several times for it to connect.  Then it works for a while and the same thing happens.I was sold a broken system.. It's not my phone its a problem with BMW and their relation with Apple.  Friends have apple car play with acura and lexus and no problems.
navigation system doesn't readily give you options as to other routes with or without tolls etc.  It is too many steps to figure it out before driving and can't readily change route while driving.  It does not give one up to the minute traffic issues and reroute if there is a problem..  I don't need direction to get there I need the shortest time and option whether I will pay tolls or not.  I have to reselect to get other options and and can't switch between them easily.  I have sat down with a genius several times and they conferred not a great system.  Waze is much more user friendly and accurate.  BMW is by far the worst I have used.
I have chosen to not to use it as it only adds time to my drive..but everytime I use it it is inaccurate as to the time it takes and the best route is not the best route..
basically just the apple car play and the frustration  to switch between systems it is not a simple switch.   The dealers answer says its a problem but they can't do anything about it.  I paid extra for the system and feel like I like I was taken.  The dealer answer is just thats the way it is.
It is difficult to plug in seat belt.  Location is too far back and the angle is not negotiable. If you don't put it in just right you can't get it in.  The receiving in doesn't bend forward so you have to get it in just the right angle to reach it. : Find it difficult to plug in seat belt on drivers side as the the latch is difficult to fit in next to the console.  Its a tight space and if you don't have the right angle you can't get it in.  The receiving end for the belt does not bend nor is it flexible so it is difficult to get it in without several tries and readjusting..It seems like it is a bit too far back.

side pocket in door too small, can't fit water bottle in there.  Water bottles in cup holder often fall over if too tall.
Difficult to reach center cup holder while driving.  It is too low down. In previous car there was a removable cup holder that was easier to access and a place in the drivers door for a bottle.There is neither of these in this car.  A left handed cup holder for the driver would be helpful
the handle shifts too easily.. the engine doesn't shift on its own. : control slips easily out of drive to another gear.. Moves over with the lightest touch and driver is unaware of the switch

The system freezes on the ApplePlay screen and/or the navi screen
: the front parking aid does not always work. It does not beep ro identify that I am parking and will not notify me of how close a curb or wall is in front of my vehicle
: the car 'bucks' sometimes when pressing on the throttle. I will have to immideatly let off the gas and let the RPMs settle and then press evenly on the pedal again to push the DTC into the next gear.
sometimes the proximity sensor does not work to let me open the door by pulling. I have to use the key fob to enter the vehicle. Once I start the engine the screen displays 'increased battery drain while car was turned off, if issue persists seek service'





I haven't really researched this function yet.






not sure, sometimes when I have car 'unlocked' it still won't open . I have to start car and turn off... not entirely clear on how it works
its a weird clunking noise when braking all of a sudden
hard to see, easy to change setting when using different key to turn on car

Rocks from the highway leave small chips in the white paint

Whenever I have attempted to use the self parking system to parallel park, the car has driven the right rear wheel into the curb.
The process includes holding down the parking button throughout the parking process, which is cumbersome.  Also, the button to activate the self-parking system is the same button used to activate the rear and surround cameras.  The self parking controls should be separate from the camera controls so the driver can activate the cameras without initiating self-parking.
The Apple CarPlay integration is mediocre.  It frequently conflicts with the manufacturer infotainment system.  There should be a separate control/interface with the CarPlay system and the driver should be able to use both as desired .
: The idrive system doesn't remember the last setting and has rebooted itself.


My old X3 could connect two phones at the same time.  More could be paired.  The new X3 only lets one phone be connected at a time.  It appears the last connected phone stays connected until another is connected and doesn't follow the key pairing.
It preferentially chooses pandora app for music as soon as you enter the vehicle and cellphone is within range!

Door lock control in center of car on dash, it is hard to unlock all car doors if you've already stepped out of the car.  Leaning back in is inconvenient.
There should be a USB port on dash.
The headliner moves when windows are open.  It whips in the wind.
Knocking noise comes from engine at start, or while idle or in park, at least that's when I hear it.  Sometimes it just goes away while driving, sometimes I have to turn off and restart engine for it to go away.
It is too heavy for me.
Media device ports difficult to use. I am going tomorrow to check on this.
I will take it to dealer for help with this.
In a difficult place-too far forward
: the rear hatch keeps opening up without explanation, perhaps because i inadvertently press the release button, but i don;t think so.
doesn't switch from driver #1 to driver #2 even though both phones are paired
difficult to operate, very confusing
Push button open/close often doesn't work, must manually open/close
it has only happened less than a handful of times. when i come to a slow stop, it squeaks a little.
I can not for the life of me figure out how to property adjust the mirrors to my liking when I'm in reverse. It's very confusing!!!
The noise indicators are beyond annoying. And the only way to turn them off is to push a button- but that also gets rid of the camera. There should be a way to either turn the volume of or at the very least, lower it!
I like to sit really low in my car. Even after positioning the heads-up display as highest possible, i still need to prop myself up to see it.
Apple Car Play has a lot of glitches. If I switch songs, it takes a good 5-10 seconds before the song actually switches. There is a lag time.
when I turn my car on and it's really cold, there's a rattling noise in the exhaust pipe. It goes away after the car warms up.
: There was an error which asked us to take the car to the dealership. The dealership let us know that it was problem with a part failing which was related to charging the battery
Usually takes a few tries to get hood to shut...not intuitive and requires more effort than most vehicles.
Typical BMW issue when equipped with M performance brakes.
Tried using this several times in empty parking lots and it seems to work only 50% of the time.  Simpler just to park the vehicle yourself.
The voice recognition is not intuitive.  You have to speak specific commands to get it to recognize.
Compared to my Ford Edge, the ventilared seats in the BMW make a lot of noice but do not return noticeable temperature differences.

Bottom seats are very hard. You can feel feel your buttocks hitting hard when experiencing even small bumps. : Seats are kind low and very hard. In other words not soft and comfortable.

Polarized sunglasses block the HUD image
The wiper control stick is easy enough to find but has a number of icons and directional movement indicators. My problem is finding the correct 'knob' and direction to turn on the rear window wiper/washer. Perhaps a separate 'stick' or button would help??
Control button should be located near display panel/center of the dashboard for easy access.
Control button is hard to locate.  it should be located on the steering wheel, on the center console or on the center of the dashboard for easy access.

Foot sensor to open the trunk hands-free doesn't work consistently.  It worked very well the first few weeks I had the car, but now it only works about 10% of the times I try to use it.
Hard to distinguish which icon is for tilting vs. sliding the glass and which icon is just for the sunshade.  Also would prefer sunshade to auto-close once engaged, rather than having to hold the switch the entire time
Took me a long time to figure out where the controls for the power headrests were.
Being the truck is a dark grey, I noticed the very fine scratches on the paint as they are white . They look as if something fine brushed up against the doors in transit, such as a tree branch. The one near the windshield is a bit deeper.
The button for the heated steering wheel is on the steering column.  You can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see it, so you have to know what you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re feeling for which is beyond stupid. On this X5 they did add a notice that pops up on the screen to tell you if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve activated or deactivated the warmer. They should move the control to the front of the steering wheel where it used to be, my first few X5s had the button right on the front of the wheel.
The 'Comfort' setting for the suspension is not very comfortable.

Replaced guide which fixed the problem. .2.  Wiper blade squeaks against windshield when wet.  Identified by dealer as deteriorated blade .  Wiper blades were both replaced.  Noise is no longer present.

: The Mobile Phone is sometimes used to play music.  When that is the case, it sometimes starts and restarts the music multiple times  after playing the first few seconds.
Noticeable when on slight downhill incline and going slowly.

slow response
When I arrived home right after delivery I opened the hood to look at the engine.  The hood was not completely closed from the dealership .. meaning there was a gap on the left side as if the hood was not completed engaged the capture mechanism.  I opened all the way and when I went to close it was difficult to close.  It did not just close easy by gravity.  It required me to physically place pressure on the hood with both hands to close.  The hood in fact seem a bit flimsy from a steel rigidity point of view.
Squek from time to time.  take to dealer and they clean them.  Works well until next oil change, approximately and dealer will clean again.

Front brakes started making noise after two months of delivery

Sometimes vehicle itself disconnects calls when connected to bluetooth. Once it happens it keeps happening until either car is restarted or bluetooth is reset.
Engine makes frequent noise when idling after engine warms, especially going down from 2k rpm to idle. The noise comes and goes back it self. Also, noise started increasing as number of miles are increasing. Took it to dealer, dealer told it sounds normal.
City MPG is around 19 and highway not more than 25.
Happens at times when started from lower gear and car stays in lower gear for a long time even when road is just straight .
Small ding.  Was repaired quickly within days via paintless dent removal.
My wife cannot get the front passenger headrest in a suitable position for herself.
The built in sunglasses case is too small.  My sunglasses do not fit.
Tire caught very very small tiny nail and went flat.  Because it is low profile and run flat, I didn't even know I had a flat until I went to Discount tire for adjusting tire pressure after tire pressure warning light came on.  It is scary to have a flat and not even know about it.  And strange these brand new tires are so sensitive to a tiny tiny nail.
It didn't indicate that I had a flat.
: This is not a problem but rather an observation.  The belt line is very high and the seat can only be raised to a certain limit.  My view is limited compared to other sedans.
AC does work but it doesn't have powerful cooling as I expect as compared to other cars I have or have had.
The door does not unlock with the car periodically
: Car stopped on freeway with Drive train failure message.  Dealership kept the car for 4-5 days - have seen the recorded event on the computer log - but could not find anything wrong with the car.  Event did not repeat.
Took final delivery and inspection after darkness.  When at home in garage in daylight while detailing it, at a longview angle I spotted a slight one-inch ding without broken paint surface, in the area marked.  It appeared to be they type done by another vehicle door opening, and my vehicle was not in this environment to be dinged from the time I took delivery until I found the ding. The dealer did not dispute and repaired the ding at no charge to me.  It looks like a perfect repair, and I am satisfied.  This ding could have occurred anytime from assembly plant release in Germany to dealer delivery, storage, and vehicle demonstration to customers.
: Shortly after Bluetooth connects my phone to my car, the audio system changes from my normal SiriusXM station Presets that I am already playing to what it says on the vehicle screen as Pandora, seemingly as an unconfirmed default.  But it doesn't even play Pandora; it plays my music downloads that are on my iPhone.  And it plays them in different order than listed on my phone, but in this same order each time.  I have to then override and reselect my SiriusXM Presets.  Dealer BMW Product Genius is unable to determine why this happens.  This technology problem is a bit annoying.
See earlier explanation.  Shutdown no longer works when in Comfort driving/handling setting, but does in Eco setting.  This is my preference, but unclear if this was 'fixed' by the dealer during a service when in the shop for a ding repair, or if it has malfunctioned when in the Comfort setting - to be determined next service visit. : The engine stop function when the vehicle is stopped, which saves fuel when in traffic stop and go conditions, originally worked in both Comfort and Eco driving/handling settings. Now, it works only in Eco setting, which is acceptable and preferable to me.  It is unclear if the dealer made this change during a recent service visit, or if it has malfunctioned to no longer work when in the Comfort setting.



If you wear a polarized sun glasses, you won't be able to see anything.
: Driver profile didn't memorize the phone. It often confused with my wife and not knowing which one to connect. Speaker's Audio quality is poor.

The hood has to be slammed in order to shut it.
The front turn signals  are excessively bright, they are so bright that the reflection off of the traffic signs make it look like there is a maintenance vehicle's sirens are on. I have received two warnings from law enforcement for how bright they are, though i have no way to dim them at all or fix it. I have also received one complaint from a driver in front of me. The dealership cannot solve this problem.
If you clean the wheels, then within 100 miles of moderate  braking, the wheels are filthy. It is common to see chunks of dust all over the place, and this in turn transmits to the doors. I decided to buy aftermarket brake pads to solve it.
The brakes used to be very sensitive , then they gradually became less and less responsive. I now have to give moderate to heavy foot pressure to get the car to stop to my liking, including even in parking lots. I find this unacceptable for a 4 piston setup.
I often accidentally press the brake when my intent is the gas. They should be 1/4' further apart from where they are now.
This is a design flaw: since it is electric and not hydraulic, there are numerous dead spots throughout the radius. Though not a terrible system, i miss the hydraulic steering on my 10 year old mitsubishi - it was far superior in every way. I do NOT want the steering wheel to have more resistance. Resistance does not solve the inherent flaw of electric steering systems.
: As ive already said: the collision warning system is very invasive and has literally almost resulted in accidents. I have to manually disable it every time i start the car; and when i forget to, i learn my lessson. I will never buy a car that has this 'feature' again. Im not a retarded driver, i don't need nannies getting in my way.
: The car has a collision warning system that is overly sensitive. A large red icon of a car invades my center field of vision from the heads up display, and it serves as a distraction. There have been over ten instances where it distracts me and nearly causes an accident. I have to manually disable it every single time i start the car, because it always turns back on each time. This is unsolvable unless its completely removed from the car, which the dealership is unable to do.
Both the left driver vent, and left-most CENTER vent no longer blow air anymore.
If the A/C or fan or heater is on, even at the lowest setting, it sounds like a broken computer fan. It's not smooth. My 20 year old cheap car by comparison doesn't sound this bad.
When decelerating in a parking lot , it can get caught in 3rd gear and 2nd gear, when in reality it should be at 2nd or 1st max. This results in the car bucking back and fourth. I intentionally put the car in manual mode when this happens.

ordered roof rack very difficult to install
Two issues with trunk door: 1) the feature where you move your foot under the car to open the trunk doesn't always work, and 2) as I noted earlier, the trunk door does not always stay open while I'm reaching into the cargo area - the door has almost closed on my body a couple of times. : The trunk door automatically closes while I'm still putting things in the trunk. The trunk door has almost hit my head a couple of times while I was reaching into the cargo area.  I've had to quickly scramble to get out of it's way before it closes on me.
I've not yet been able to set the door locks the way I want them to operate.
Does not light up enough and too small.
: Heads Up Display has a glare and reflection in windshield when not in use on a sunny or very clear day.  Needs a pad to put on screen when not using display.  Very annoying.




: Passenger seat belt latch vibrates against interior wall when not in use most of the time.
The trunk has assisted opening by using your foot.  The sensor is so small that you have to be exactly in the right place for it to work.  The sensor runs long wise and should run the width of car for easier access
When reaching for cup, the transmission shifter is in way.  On passenger side cup holder, when reaching for cup there is button that gets turn on often as it is in close proximity
I am told that the road noise is coming from the run-flat tires. As the car accelerates, I can hear the oscillating noise increase in speed.At higher speeds, it is hard to ignore.

loud rumble

It doesn't open fully, then you have to manually open it.
: Upon entering the car, my paired phone will automatically start up these three apps - Pandora, Spotify, and BMW Connect. I don't know why, i did not set them up to do this. Each time i enter the car they pop up. The BMW Connected app makes me actively sign on or select 'skip' before i can close/get rid of it. I usually get rid of all three apps on the phone, but it is annoying.
: I do not like the interior center console compartment. Why is it wide open? I would prefer the box in the center to be closed so that stuff I put in it, can not be seen by the passenger or anyone else. Weird design that it is open. The side door storage panels have a section for what looks like a water bottle, but strangely is way too big to hold a standard water bottle. The glove compartment door is 'open' at the crease between the glove compartment itself and the door when open, so if you have something small it can fall out in that opening. Seems strange that it wouldn't be designed as one panel that has no opening when you open the door.

I would like to use the Phone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s voice system instead. There is a huge problem with BMW Voice assist, doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t recognize commands and I can barely use it.
Biggest controls missing for me: can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see the rear view mirror and side mirror adjustments when a new driver comes to drive the car. Every time i have to reset my controls for seating positions.
dont like the light on the side rather than in the mirror like other cars have
we ran the ac on maximum in houston in March during a day when the temp was only in the 80s. . max AC never cooled down the car after 20 minutes of driving with engine on.

I find that using waze in lieu of the onboard navigation is both more accurate, easier to read, and is more timely in the information.
It has been difficult to sync our remote keys to the different drivers 

need to be a bit larger and easier to see
I would like to have the ability to have the engine stay on at stops without having to turn this feature on each time I start the car
Does not always open when squeeze handle.  Foot control does not work well
The rubber at the base of the window squeaks when closing the door.  The window moves upward about a half inch when closing the door, by design.  It is during this function that the rubber squeaks.
when washing the 750 i  notice water on the inside of rubber gasket seal of all door gasket seals.
Said this before in the last survey, there is a deep scratch on the passenger side 'shadow line trim' which is plastic. Brought it back for dealership to look at but they told me to just buff it out my self because it would be hard or close to impossible to replace that part.
Same as previous
Wheel is too lose, prefer tighter steering and better response.
Just not clear on how to use one time wipe? If u don't hold it down long enough it doesn't wipe,  will spray but not wipe
Not sure where it is , have accessed it from screen
Can't lock doors from inside car, have to touch handle  when leaving
View block by steering wheel and have accidentally activated the button next to it that shuts off the engine when stopping
Just started yesterday!
Have tried to audible a command and command is incorrect. I.e. Call for radio station and conn street to navigation
Pulls to the right, need to take to dealer to check alignment.
Often does not recognize the request to phone an individuals cell with response of another individual or no action
Going into a driveway the rear suspension unloads and creaks
Intermittent
Does not clearly recognize words even talking very slowly
would like the driver keyless door to open the passenger door with a DOUBLE touch of the handle. No way to unlock passenger door as wanted.  No unlock inside on drivers side as well.
does not recognize roads that really exist, really needs to update the maps
sun visor is TOO SMALL and does not swing out to the side to extend along the side window, Really inadequate!





When wearing a coat or jacket, it is difficult to buckle up because console is too close and attachment to seat belt is too low. : When wearing a jacket or coat, it is difficult to lock in the seatbelt because center console is in the way.



Battery still charging when car turned off

cell phone charger does not work


The drivers door lock will, at times, unlock and lock back as you try to get into the car. One may have to try four or five times to get in before you can get in. Then I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had trouble getting the tail hatch to come all the way down when the button is pushed. The door only comes about half way and stops. It won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go down the rest of the way or back up when you push the button. I have to start the car up and push the button from inside the car.
High beam icon is behind steering wheel, it needs to be located elsewhere on dash.



If I put the seat up high, I fall getting out of the car to the ground. Then it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a need of steps to get back inside.
My husband and I have a hard time when we both get in the car with our keys. The car doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know which the follow and the seats are moving back and forth. When he gets in the car he changes all my settings and then when I get in I have to reset everything again, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a big pain!
It hard to adjust the temperature. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve read the book and tried to turn knobs and push screens but just can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem to get the temperature adjusted to suit in hot weather.


The glove box is very small.
The center console is very small as well.
The clock displays are tiny!! The control screen has a date display that is at least 1/2' letters but the clock display is not on the control screen and in the smallest numbers you can have and still find them at the top right hand corner and very very small. The date is on the screen all the time. Now what is the logic of having a date that is going to be the same for the next 24 hours while the clock information is changing every second?
The seat belt female end is to short and the seat cushon blocks your had as well as the arm rest.
Just something you all could work a little harder at, not as quiet inside of the vehicle as I think it could be
Just keep the door lock in the same place you have always had it in the middle near the hazard lights, why the change
the above describes it well enough, make it bigger, but to where it doesn't sit in the drivers lap
I do not like where the knob fit the media is. It should be on the steering wheel.
: The remote trunk latch release on the key is overly sensitive.  This causes a frequent and repeated situation of having the trunk spontaneously  open during the course of entering and starting the vehicle. Note that as the driver is opening, entering and starting the vehicle, the key is in the right front pants pocket.  Which means the trunk opening command is being triggered simply by the normal pressure between the driver's upper thigh and the pants pocket.  And no, the pants being worn aren't  snug/tight... stop laughing :)Simply lower the surface of the trunk relase button slightly below the top surface of the key -- problem solved.
Odometer: location is very low on instrument panel, causing the odometer display to be obscured by the top of the steering wheel column. Driver must stretch neck upward in order to see past the steering column to the odometer display.Engine temperature gauge: an engine temperature display is provided, however, it resides within a multi-purpose display area of the instrument console . For a performance vehicle such as the BMW M2, engine temperature should reside on a dedicated, permanent gauge on the instriment console to allow the driver to immediately understand whether the engine is at the proper operating temperature. It's difficult to understand why the designers provided Flickr, a news feed,, Yelp, and Apple CarPlay , but have negleted to provide a dedicated engine temperature display.
The cup holder is located far forward; the console above the cup holder location has a slight overhang over the cupholder location.  The small vertical clearance between the two makes it difficult to place and remove a tall container from the cupholder.  When inserting or removing a tall container from the cupholder, the driver must tilt the container to allow the container to fit into the tight vertical clearance space between the cupholder opening and the console overhang directly above, which typically causes spillage of the container contents.  Moving the cupholder slightly rearward, or moving the console overhang slightly forward, would create adequate clearance to allow a container to be inserted or removed in a direct vertical motion and eliminate the need for tilting of the container.

The center console storage is very shallow and won't hold much.  It also pivots and I'm afraid it will break off if I lean on it
The front cup holder is underneath the dashboard and is difficult to use.  Additionally, I have to lift the cup over the electronics in the center console and I'm afraid I'll spill the drink onto the electronics
Sounds as if the front driver's door isn't fully closed or the window isn't fully closed.  But, they are both closed...but wind noise is louder than any car I've ever been in.
Steering wheel was slightly off-centered but was promised it would be corrected.  The suspension noise was noticed prior to delivery, but told it was tire/wheel noise - which has turned out not to be the case.  It is a problem yet to be resolved.
Noise seems to be the same pitch and cadence, regardless of speed, so long as moving above 20-25 mph.  There is a slight change  on brand new concrete pavement, but still exists.  It is not wind noise in my opinion.  The best description is it sounds like an old fashioned coffee percolator when it is beginning to boil and the filter guts are starting to rattle 
If I only pair by Bluetooth and use Spotify on my phone, I can't switch songs with the buttons on the steering wheel.If I pair with Bluetooth and use ConnectedDrive to open Spotify with the iDrive controller, I can switch songs but the when I choose a song with the steering wheel button it jumps to the wrong song. The Spotify connection in ConnectedDrive is also very unstable/slow.
nor very user friendly
I have hard time in using self parking system
The fact that the car does not automatically lock when I leave it is one of the most frustrating things about the car. It is frankly unacceptable for a $100K car being sold in the US to be missing this feature. It is also unacceptable that the car doesn't have remote engine start. Also, the trunk hands free sensor rarely works correctly on the first try which makes it pretty useless.
The self parking feature seems to provide no indication of what spot it thinks it wants to park in which makes the feature pretty pointless. There needs to be a good way to identify the intention of the system and influence which spot it should choose. The steps the user needs to take to actually instigate parking aren't clear either, but the fact that there is no way to know what the car intends to do prevents me from trying to understand the actual steps required to use it anyway.
I have never seen built-in vehicle voice recognition work correctly, and this car is no exception. At least the car hands off many voice recognition tasks to Siri on the iPhone so that is a huge improvement, otherwise I'd never use any voice recognition in the car.
There have been three or four times that I've experienced problems with the phone reconnecting after I get out of the car to fill up with gas on a long trip. I have not been able to come up with a way to reproduce the problem reliably, but when it happens, the only way to force the phone and car to reconnect is to power off the phone and turn it on again.
Light colored leather easily stained by dark jeans
Just didnt work as expected. I feel like i ' hear' more than actually it works
Even if you dont touch the actual seat adjustments, the menu prompt comes up on the dashboard.  It is especially annoying when the passenger adjusts the set and the prompt comes up and overrides the GPS that was on the screen.  I dont feel it necessary to have the prompt display every time you adjust.  That feature should be able to be turned off.

It just started happening where sometime's it won't connect with the car but my phone will say there connected. And sometimes lately if I'm on a call and hang up and then go to get out of the car I can still hear the other peoples conversation going on in the car, it won't transfer over to my phone it's really weird.
Triangle lights in side mirrors should provide a bolder color . Yellow color is too subtle and does not provide sufficient blind spot warning.
Cup holders tucked a little too far under the dash area. Difficult to put in and take out.
Small circular pin point chip
sounds like knock when revs slowing. Will have dealer check at 1200 mile service.
Can;t understand how to use system.

determined road force pressure too high and replaced tire.
Way too small
specific to front wheel drive - All wheel drive is much smoother 


: audio/entertainment system sporadically won't allow radio station to be changed followed by reboot of entire systems
We had to take the car to the dealer to close the hood after we looked at the engine after we bought it. It's like you have to do a closed fist karate chop in the right spot to close it.
I still can't figure out how to close the front moonroof.
I can't figure out how to change the time.
Way to small.
: Computer screen jumping from screen to screen unprompted.
: The steering is still tight relative to most other comparables, but looser than it used to be. You get used to it,
There are a lot of gears in this transmission, 8 i think they told me, When it accelerates from stop one can feel a brief hesitation in lower gear shifting.
Had to slam hood to close.  Dealer said that all the x3 seemed to be that way and that it was okay to slam it. This is my 5th BMW and I know that it could be adjusted.
: Seat stitching pulled and began to give opening up the seems in the front bucket seats

Spotify is difficult to use. I have to re-pair APPs w/phone every time i start the car.
The buckle is too low in between the seat and center consul on both seats
Location of rear lift hatch button on the key fob causes it to be engaged and the rear hatch being opened when not wanting it to be.  Have left the vehicle and came back and the rear hatch was open all day as the key fob opened the hatch while in my pocket, unintentionally.  Definitely a safety issue for items inside the trunk!
Air suspension system is noisy upon unlocking the vehicle initially.  The exhaust is noisy at the beginning when first starting the vehicle.   Wil take SUV into the dealership to assess.
Volume knob in poor locatin and should be MUCH larger.  Blur tooth functions inconsistently for playing songs off my cellular telephone; very annoying. : Not much they can do about poor design of the volume control and the lack of ports for phones and other electronic devices until they re-design it.
Way more ports are needed and in much more convenient locations. Feel like they are 10 Tara behind in this aspect! : Not much they can do about poor design of the volume control and the lack of ports for phones and other electronic devices until they re-design it.
I've had a couple of people say that when they tried to open the door using the handle, the skin on the edge of their finger got caught between the moving parts of the handle. Not a big problem, just a matter of inconvenience in that we have to remember not to use the handle in a certain way.

I use an iPhone, so it might be linked to that.
I've tried to set it using the instructions in the manual, but even if I use the same remote, it still resets the seat to the other setting when I open the car using the remote.
The part of the floor mat near the accelerator pedal is a bit uncomfortable to put the foot on. Not a big issue though.
My iphone7 automatically pairs correctly 97% of the time, but on 3-4 occasions out of 100 it has not paired for no reason I can determine.  The only way I have found to get the car and phone to pair in those situations is to 'forget device,' turn car completely off, turn car back on, and repair.

Control panel often does commands and switches modes without me doing anything.  It sometimes goes haywire.  I have to turn the car off for a while to reset it.

The heated steering wheel is a great feature but it does not stay on long enough for me and there is no manual on and off control that I can find.
The seatbelt warning sound comes on when no one is sitting in the passenger seat, nothing in on the passenger seat and I have my seat belt on.  I finally just keep the seat belt on the passenger side locked engage to avoid the alarm.
The port for the iPod is in a very awkward location.  located behind the middle storage box.
passenger seat belt warning noise/bell goes off when no one is in the passenger seat and when there are no objects on the seat so I have to keep the passenger side seat belt clicked closed at all times.
The steps are so narrow that they are almost useless.
Both indicators are not paired with the audible signal
Both controls do not provide audible signal
We purchased Apple Carplay to supposedly make things simpler and easier to use.  This has not been our experience.  Probably a user training issue but it is a point of frustration for both my wife and I.
You would think that you could just set the temperature on auto and forget about it.   Even when you've achieved the proper temperature in auto the fan is usually working overtime.  In taking it out of auto just to control the fans speed, the controls seem to cycle on and off sometimes.  Recognize that I have only had this car during the cool parts of the year.  It has been difficult at times to get the temperature inside the car to be comfortable.
The interior handle on the driver door broke easily after less than a week of delivery. The cable in the door was loose and disengaged from the handle.
It turns color of garment you ate wrari9 : The seats soil easily,  turn blue or what ever color the garment you are wearing
All info was captured correctly
Coming out of a Lexus where the steering wheel is pretty firm....it took getting adjusted to the looseness of the BMW steering wheel. I'm not sure if it is manufactured that way or not.
The tire pressure is always low. The indicator us always on.
Side vent  is difficult to feel air coming out of it, it's blocked by the steering wheel
When the fan reaches level 4, it's really quite loud, much louder than level 3
The a/c is just not super cold so I have to turn it up higher but the fan is loud when I do that
When I'm stopping and going around town, the engine isn't smooth when I am accelerating from a stop sign to driving
Some condensation was building up after washing or heavy rain. Dealer dried out the headlight and the issue has not been observed since.
Intermittently voice recognition misunderstands commands with navigation
Battery not charging warning light went off. Took the car to BMW and they corrected it imediately
rough idle on one trip. no malfunction errors and no check engine light and was fine after restart. dealer was not able to replicate and no errors were stored.
Car had a malfunction code and went into limp home mode. The cause was a misfire. Dealer cleared the code and it has not happened again. This was at 358 miles.
glove box would not stay closed.
: The navigation system has twice stopped working.  Operation was restored with a reboot.
Automatic seat positioning data are stored in the keys.  We experienced some difficulty with the seat going to the same position regardless of which key was in play when the door opened.  We eventually resolved the problem, apparently by resetting the seat location memory settings manually.
Seat bolsters are too narrow and hard to be comfortable for a large person .




TO SMALL, YOUR EYES HAVE TO LOOK DOWN ON THE DASH.
The outside temp, mileage, speed to small to read in the display dashboard.
It gets hot and then cools off on its own. I have owned the Vehicle for only 3 months.
water/snow gets in trunk - not confined to runoff area
If it is snowing or heavy rain - every time I stop I get a collision warning from the camera malfunctioning, because it is covered with water/ice/snow. It is very annoying
voice recognition stinks
the voice recognition is terrible, and the manual input is an extremely long process. Doesn't default to the current area you are in.
I have had the car wash clean it - It is an oyster color leather that scuffs easily.
: the rear window defroster is very slow
it is too tiny
the cup holder is too close to the dash, preventing my insulated coffee tumbler from fitting properly, it tilts away from the dash.
Door handles are too far forward & don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t allow leverage for such big/ heavy door. No place to grab door when pushing open to stop it from swinging wide & hitting something.
The double pull required to open from inside is poor design.
: Right Brake Light Manlfunction
At 1400 miles car parked in garage will not start.  BMW Road side assistance came and 'dragged' the vehicle onto the flatbed tow truck 'in park' because with no start you can't get it in neutral. Towed to the dealer, at dealer for three days, mechanic determined 'defective from factory' actuator for eccentric shaft after tearing apart the brand new engine.  We are concerned about future transmission problems from the tow procedure.
It was the same incident that we just described


: Heads up display disappears in direct sun.
The fender was scratched upon delivery to the dealership.
It is the run flat tires that make the road noise.
Car has been a the dealership twice for this issue and they are having a problem finding the rattle. it is at the dealer now for two days. I don't know if it is fixed.
When iPhone is plugged in to port for charging, the Apple play commands take over the media system and interrupt satellite radio/music playing until you manually click back to music
A lot of force needs to be applied to properly close the hood. If insufficient force is applied, then the hood is stuck in a non-open non-closed state which forces me to unlatch the hood from inside the car then open and close the hood again.
: The rear right window shade has two plastic brackets which holds the factory-installed window shade when it is pulled up. One of the two brackets broke within the first month after delivery preventing us from using the window shade.
: The audio will just randomly jump from my presets either to the general satellite listing or to link with my iTunes or pandora .
Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t lift seat high enogh
Too small for many insulated mugs
: When you are within a quarter mile of your destination, the GPS tells you, but does not tell you on which side of the street  your destination is.  On a multi-lane highway, if you are trying to find your destination, you need to know which side.  Visiting an unfamiliar city, with major highways, I found myself making u-turns all too frequently.  Very, very annoying. How hard can it be to say your destination is a quarter of a mile ahead on the right?  In addition, the visual on the GPS does not show which side at a quarter mile.  It's only when you arrive that the visual shows which side.  Too late!
Heater, getting heat to blow into car is so confusing, as is having the AC light on while I am trying to get heat to blow into the car.  Seriously do not like heating/cooling controls. : The heater controls are counter-intuitive.  It is miserable to try to figure out, while driving, how to get heat and whether the heat is on or off.  The AC light comes on when the heater is on.  What sense does this make?  I do not like the heat/AC controls - too confusing.  Salesman said that nothing is wrong; the AC light just comes on while you want heat. Nothing to be done about it.
We often drive to Gloucester.  For some reason the navigation system will take us out of the way.  We believe it may be set to no tolls; but have not had the time to research the settings.  I would like it to hold the directions that we normally take.

Bluetooth does not automatically connect with music or apps.
when i push the memory number, it does not seem to return to the set positions


: blower for Ac stopped working after a 5 hour highway drive. Eventually reset computerBlower for heat stopped working after parked overnight and had to reset computer.
two episodes of blower not working to circulate air. had to turn car off and lock for 10 minutes to reset computers.
It was not intuitive to change the position of the rear headrests. I had to consult the manual for what should be a fairly easy and quick thing to change.
: I cannot see the headsup display with sunglasses on. The sunglasses block the color of the heads up display.

Automatic sensor doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work well

When my iPhone X is connected through Apple Car Play it frequently seizes up, stops playing, comes in and out and usually ends up disconnecting the phone entirely.
the trunk wont open all the way : when you try open or close trunk it doesnot open or close all the way
will ask to call someone or drive to street name cant pick it up
Hear noises from center console cant figure it out, really annoying
Braking and stopping have to be 'just so,' for the engine to shut down and not automatically restart. It's more delicate than I'd have thought, because it works best if you 'ride the brake' a little. Something they teach you in driving class *not* to do!
This only happened a couple of times, but after refueling occasionally I will need to manually compress the pin that keeps the fuel door closed/locked because it gets stuck. It's not a big deal as it's easy to do, but I wish the problem didn't exist.
It's hard to know when it'll invite you to let it park itself.
It's a little weak overall in full 'Auto' mode.
Whenever i need to use it, its hard to find and have to press really hard.
At times i have had specific addresses that the system was able to find.  Not entirley sure how/when it gets updated
: I constantly have to readjust my personal settings after the car is not in use. I do have my driver seat settings saved . However,  I would say almost every 3 times i use the car i have to recall the driver seat settings. Im not sure what triggers it to move and therfore has to be reset.  I am the only driver and use the same key fob. I have expressed this to the dealer. The recommendation was to save my driver seat settings without a true explanation of why. : Heads-up display and main display same issue as seat transitioning to a different position or display after car is not in use.

I have only noticed it occurring when i leave my parking garage at work.  As i pull out of the space my car hesitates a bit until i turn thr corner and leave .  I havent taken it to the dealer because i only notice it at that time.  My previous X5 did it as well.
Door locks not in the door is counterintuitive. Not a major issue but takes some getting used to.
Front center cup holder can be a challenge for taller cups.
Noise from non-smooth pavement is much higher than from a BMW X3  and is annoying at higher speeds when the audio volume must be increased to compensate.
Center console has to be raised to allow passenger to operate seat belt.
Common problem. The rubber seals squeak BAD. No solution from BMW. The common fix  is to apply 'Gummipflege' which is available on Amazon
Same as front doors.
Definitely some air entering from around the driver window. Not a huge issue but will mention it at the first servicing

System does not seem to recognize the correct seat position when both keys are in the car.
It is not terrible, but when comparing it to other vehicles, the middle arm rest tends to get in the way.
I am not sure this is a problem, just when I am turning, sometimes, I will press the gas and it goes slowly and it is almost as if it changes gears and then it surges forward.
Sometimes the cap doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go down far enough so Door won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t close
Was told it was normal but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s louder on passenger side than drivers side
The silver metal on console and door gets extremely hot
Manual, not power. : Too little distance between lowest steering wheel and seats.

Sometimes after I have made one call or finished a call if I move on to trying to give a voice command for another call it will tell me that I need to connect a bluetooth device. I then usually skip the voice command and connect the call manually.
I have a lot of problems opening the sunroof/moon roof other than the tilt mode. Always takes several tries to get the correct setting from the controls.
I don't feel any difference when I use this feature.
It was a valve in the engine problem.
I would like to see the number of gallons of gas I have
The headresg is horrible. It push my head forward. Wish I can remove it or adjust it back
When I open the trunk it does not open all the way up, I have to push it up.
Some phones will connect through Bluetooth and others don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t.
: When going over speed bumps  the weather stripping around the doors makes a noticeable sound as if the body is flexing.
The auto setting for the climate control really is not auto at all.  It does not control fan speed whatsoever; BMW calls the fan speed 'intensity'.  The effect is that you need to adjust the temperature to where you want it and then the fan speed.  As far as I am concerned, this is the same way my 1969 Dodge worked.  I had a Lexus and my wife has an Infinity, and on those vehicles you choose the temperature and the car does the rest.  Truly automatic.
The insulated mug I use is not huge by any means, but it is almost too tall to fit due to the protrusion of the radio/climate controls.
water leaks/drips from side view mirrors after washing
noise comes from vents when air is blowing at low speed. Almost sounds like something is blocking the airflow.
I have to set the temperature below 69 degrees to feel comfortable inside the vehicle.
Compared to my 2013 bmw 550i the seat heat at full power on the old car was hot fast and became too hot under normal use.  The new car warms but really never gets hot
seat belt buckle worked but made a rattle noise which had to be replaced
Can not see while wearing polarized sunglasses
radio switches on own to Pandora and stops working
Idles roughly at cold start/misses
Not clear under what conditions a warning occurs!!  No way to tell if it will actually apply brakes.
motor stopped working : passenger seat motor failed.
coolant leaked out
I brake lightly and it squeals already at less the 3k miles

 : Does not port well with android phones
On multi-lane freeway, it will only say 'bear Left/Right' which often sends you in wrong direction; it will want you to do a u turn and say 'bear a sharp left'; it will not display the name of the street to turn until you are right on it; it does not say the name of the street until right on it; at FWY speeds, it will let you know of a turn only 1 mile or less away .  The navigation system is the only thing I do not like about the car.
Too heavy to close. Need more 'help' from the pistons
Horn has delay,
Multiple devices not recognizeed via USB : Multiple devices not recognizeed via USB
Lever to fold seat forward is difficult to reach
Hard to reach lever to fold front seat forward
Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem to cool off as quickly or get as cool as our old x5


CarPlay is buggy, but I researched online and found that's the case with the iPhone X.
With the orange light ON the engine/restart/stop button [which means that I have turned off the start and stop function] when I pull my car into my garage until the sensor has continuous beep I experience some stalling and the engine would stop.  I would have to lightly press the gas pedal so the car can slowly pull forward until the steady beep would sound and I would press the Park button.  Occasionally while the car stalls the radio turns off as well.  I believe this should not happen when you turn off the start/stop function...does not make sense.





Does not always respond to using foot swipe under the fender.
: Ability to open trunk with foot under bumper does not always work.
Turns off when additional feature is implemented.

Not sure how to get increased height.
Not readily apparent what allows side vents to permit air flow.
: Not a huge problem, but I have noticed that air conditioning does not cool quickly. It does cool down but air flow is limited.
Scratches were 'touched-up' by dealer...touch-up paint washed off during first week of ownership.
Brakes are overly sensitive and lack feel.Steering is vague...see Porsche 911 for steering feel
Controls suckSee Porsche sunroof controls...they work
What use is a head-up-display if the display is not visible when the driver wears polarized sunglasses?
Rear facing panel of center armrest is damaged
When the vehicle is oriented nose 'down' the engine lags when accelerating from a stop or near stop.
It doesn't always open automatically.
This is my 2nd bmw i3.  i had the same issue with my previous i3.  It needs to get AM radio.
: When my phone is connected to bluetooth, it makes a popping sound.  i have tried deleting and adding my phone and i still have the same issue.  we have 2 bmw i3's and they both do it.  our 2015's did not have this issue.  we have the same phones 
Occasionally the power tailgate will open only halfway.  I have not been able to figure out how to close the tail gate from inside the car.
Occasionally the memory settings have been reset and they needed to be resaved again.Also, the Head Up display is not saved with the memory setting.
The device which has a heavy duty Velcro and is attached to the floor became unattached when I pulled the floor mat off it.

Excess noise in AC/MAX mode.
: As with my previous i3 lease, sometimes getting into the vehicle, especially if parked on an uneven surface, the mere action of getting incan induce a 'twisting or torque' to the overall body/chassis, causing the hatch lock will disengage or unlock which triggers a rear view camera fault and an indication of an open door on the driver display screen.  I must then stop and get out to secure/close the hatch lid to continue on my way.  I have trained myself to listen for the possibility of this occurring as I get in to drive away.  This is not a daily happenstance, however the potential is always there.
when going very slow  the brakes squeal.
Sun visor doesn't extend, the sun is always in my eyes.
: The car defaults to √¢‚Ç¨≈ìeco√¢‚Ç¨¬ù mode which activates the engine start/stop function.  This results in a rough ride in city driving.
This was due to wires being chewed by an animal of some kind.  This happened 3 different times and 3 different areas.  Since my vehicle is 1 of 5 vehicles that park where I park, I find it very difficult to believe that this would only happen to my vehicle.  However, the repairs were taken care of by the dealership.
There is a lot of brake dust for less than 300 miles
Sounds like a squeek and thud. Sometimes on a turn when I decelerate.
I feel that the iDrive controller is too tall so when you manuall shift gears you rub on the iDrive knob. When you rest your arm on the arm rest you are also resting on the iDrive knob.
The center console feels that it is too far back to be practial for me to open.
The clutch pedal does not engage at a consistent height depending on rpm and primarily on deceleration.
Not easy to understand how to navigate to tire pressure monitor.
Poor design.
Too small to block sun light.  A poor design.
A half second delay when pressing down gas pedal to accelerate.
Hard to maneuver rear view mirror to desired setting. I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to move it too hard to avoid damaging it.
Hard to USB port located by cup holders when holders are occupied. Other port located under armrest
Pandora application would pair without any issues the first time I got in the vehicle. But if I had to make a short stop and turn vehicle off for a moment, Pandora would no longer pair.
Not too crazy about the transmission/engine stopping when in stop and go traffic. When I park, you would think the engine would stop but it restarts.

nav system sometimes gets names wrong or puts an address in a different city.   Phone voice recognition lost all my contacts. when i first got the car all my contacts were in the phone and I could say a name and it would call.  One day out of the blue all my contacts disappeared and now the phone does not recognize any name that I say
all my contacts were lost about 2 months after delivery.  In the beginning all my contacts were there and I could call a number by saying the name and it would answer me with that name and number and make the call.  One day for no reason, my contacts were missing and no names were recognized.  I tried bmw genius and the consierge and they both re-paired my phone with my bluetooth, but to no avail.  Its dangerous to try and make a call while driving and I am constantly looking away from the road to make calls now.


Car still moves forward with the emergency brake engaged.  This seems very strange to me.
Already described.
Clock on instrument panel is hidden at the bottom right of the dashboard and is often blocked by the steering wheel.  The clock should be in the middle of the display and up near the top. That would make it very obvious. It should also be a bit larger.  The clock on the control panel is not bright enough or large enough.  When I can't see the clock on the dashboard, I also have to turn my head and squint to see the other clock.  This takes my eyes off the road for too long.
Can't comfortably rest my elbow on the console while I am driving.  It should be a little farther toward the front.
Fuel efficiency is far less than advertised
The buckle receptical is too far down between the seat and center console. With a winter coat on it's hard to reach.
the kicking motion required to pop the truck hands free is very awkward and often does not work
It just doesn't make sense that when you shut off the car to exit that all doors don't automatically unlock and you have to push a button in the center of the dash.
It is stupid that you have to press the ignition button twice to get the radio to shut off.  It wouldn't be a big deal if the radio would shut off after like a minute, but it stays on permanently.
the light indicator on the side mirror needs to be within the mirror like other car makers.  You essentially don't even see if given the location.
Divot in the head rest
There is no option to sync the two front zones
The materials are not poor, but very slippery.  this is the case with both the carpet mats that came with the vehicle and the all season mats we purchased from the dealer.  Hard to keep you feel in the position you want to on the floor because they slide.  Particularly a pain for the drive and their gas pedal foot.

switching form navigation to Apple play - some issues  also when text is received - radio will not return have to manually select
Apple Play
The female portion of the seat buckle assembly should be a bit taller so that it reaches above the base of the seat.  The current design is the same in my previous 2015 i3 and it is hard for the passenger to buckle due to interference from the seat back and the adjacent storage box between the seats. Clearly a design flaw
: I have difficulty finding where to alert the hatch to close with the foot indicator. However I do alert the option periodically without knowing.
Sometimes press brake a little harder than normal.
vibrates sometimes when air condition is on
Storage compartment between driver and passenger seat could be higher for more comfort.

Light contact leaves marks on seat materials.
When opening the center console it is necessary to open fully before closing.

It is hard to open only, not close and only when you are trying to use the foot under the car method. It does not always work. Probably the sensor parameters are too narrow.
I checked a number of areas but I'm not sure where it is coming from. Also, a lot of road noise. At highway speeds you definitely have to turn up the radio volume a significant level.
See last comment
Two days after delivery, the right rear tire got a nail and went flat. The car was towed to the dealership. A new $277 tire was mounted. I was told the tire warranty did not cover road hazards and because of possible side wall damage to the tire if it was reused they put a new one on. So BMW uses 'disposable' tires.
The location of the release and set button is hard to get at with the headrest flush with the top of seat.....little room and difficult to get your figures in to squeeze in one hand  while trying to raise it with your other hand.
Automatic wiper system isn't consistent. Sometimes it doesn't function as it should and doesn't comply with the fast-slow speed selected by the driver for wiper movement.
Very sensitive turn signal indicator control. Hard to turn off if turned on by error as it keep switching sides with just a slight movement.
The rear view camera doesn't show when backing the car. The screen remains grayed out with no display. Has happened a few times now.
: Rear view camera doesn't show on the display screen when backing the car. Has happened multiple times. Sometimes the navigation screen is blank when starting the car and the display comes on after some time.

: Rear view camera doesn't show on the display screen when backing the car. Has happened multiple times. Sometimes the navigation screen is blank when starting the car and the display comes on after some time.


It took a while for me to learn where the sensor is to allow opening/closing by swinging my foot under the bumper. I was told several different locations depneding who I spoke with at the dealer.
Alarm would go off spontaneously. Dealer replaced parts to correct this problem after I had it in their shop twice.
USB ports hard to connect to since they are in an inconvenient place for the driver.
Misinterprets name of person I am trying to call
The storage console is under the driver's right elbow and not easily opened or closed because it catches on the driver's arm.

The passenger seat has started to wear on the side. I plan to take the car back to the dealer to have the seat replaced.
when i wash the car and dry it, water continues to run out from all top roof/mirror/gas cap seams/seals and runs down side of car by front door, rear door, mirror, gas cap  so the car is now clean and dry but has large water streaks that have to be hand dried about a half hour after washing  it is inexcusable on a $50K car  i've never had that on a previous btw
the touch button for Park is dangerous.  it is very easy to mistakenly touch the side knobs while also trying to touch the Park button and end up in Reverse  I did that yesterday and almost ran into something behind me  simple and intuitive is always better in a car, like the simple way of taking the shift handle and physically shoving it up into Park  how hard is that?
this is a widely held complaint from owners who have had multiple bmw's  the steering use to be rack and pinion, then hydraulic, no electronic  quite a bit of the road feel has been lost  my 3 is a 2018 and it is better than a 2016 but not like it was in the previous 2011 model
i much prefer my older 2011 335 in terms of the ignition key, door locks, etc  the current system is more complex and the key fob is much larger and heavier
to turn car on you press start button  to turn car off you have to press start button twice
the worst set of controls i have ever had in a bmw and i have been driving them for 50 years  they are very small, almost impossible to see and DANGEROUS to try to adjust while driving   the display for air to head, torso or feet is particularly difficult to use   whatever happened to nice big knobs that were immediately intuitive
cub holder needs to be close to your hand so you can hold it while driving  instead it is front of shift lever so if you hit a bump you have no chance to use your hand to absorb the bump  it is so obvious where it needs to go
the electronic gear shift is not physically difficult, just not intuitive  in older systems you had to exert a little effort and you know when you were in gear
I find the seat very low and I would like to raise it-
I cannot figure out how to lower the headrest.
Just warm enough where the wheel is not cold, but it definitely could be warmer. Kind of like taking a lukewarm bath
Rear window sqweak
There is a bigger gap between the front left quarter panel and windscreen and drivers door.
When I place the car manual in the glove box, the manual prevents the door from closing unless the manual is placed closer to the Front. Items get lodged in the back of the hinge preventing complete closure. Without placing anything in the glove box the door opens and closes easily.
 : Rattles : Sun roof rattles
random click noise
THE BLUETOOTH TAKES A SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER TIME TO PAIR THAN MY PREVIOUS 2013 BMW X1.  FREQUENTLY LOSES CONNECTION AFTER BEING PAIRED, THEN RANDOMLY PAIRS AND MAKES CALLS.
Sound insulation shifted while turning
this is more of a user preference than an issue.  when the phone is connected to the apply connect program errors occur.  for example, error happens when using google maps on phone and trying to listen to the radio.  always leaves the radio setting and goes to apply. frustrating.
both front seats have already turned blue from their original beige.  I assume its coming from jeans wearers but we have not worn new jeans at all.  I have had my jeans for over 3-4 years, but they are turning blue.
the station 'names' are not always available, and sometimes, a song or artist name comes up as the station name. also, very disappointed that there is no AM radio!
the memory seats seem to be related to the key, but not sure.
the car manual doesn't fit easily, and because of that, there's little room for anything else
: Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get doors, especially driver√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s to lock automatically.
Bluetooth drops out. Sysrm not compatible with my iPod. : Entertainment does not show even though it is checked off.
Had coffee spills
Plastic on emblem is scratched up
It has already been described above.
: Window tint has 2 bubbles on the passenger side window.
Put about 2000-2500 miles on the car before noticing and during winter, I wear a black jacket. The black jacket has transferred dye onto the red leather on both the leather door armrest as well as the center console armrest. I've attempted to clean it with a leather cleaner and conditioner but it hasn't worked. I think I still need to find the right product but the dye shouldn't have transferred only after a couple thousand miles. The seat itself has no dye transfer.
the sun roof interior outline dented in
It just doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem to get loud. I can keep turning the volume dial but it never gets loud like other cars I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had.Maybe this is done on purpose
Phone rings but I have to answer the actual phone because callers are not hearing meSometimes I hear dings for text sometimes I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t Honestly I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if I just didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t connect it properly
Seems inefficient at cooling, although only needed so far twice
Insulated Yeti coffee cup too tall and base too big; imperfect seating
Requires extreme force to close
weight on top of the cover stops the noise

Sometimes they work  easily and sometimes not
Physical location on steering wheel is awkward to utilize




The driver side front vent doesn't seem to work; the owner's manual is useless in finding a 'fix'
Usually takes two times to recognize voice prompts

The sliding cover did not work correctly.

Door won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t open from the inside. I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t taken it to the dealer yet.
It makes a popping bubble sound everytime it gets wet.
Would not connect to my iphone.
mobile hotspot cannot be connected.
Uncomfortable headrest.


Fuel door does NOT always  open when you tap it.
Stering wheel blocks view of instrument panel : Speedometer gauge view obstructed by stering wheel
Handle blocked by stering wheel.
Stering wheel blocking handle
Mainly inconvenient that you have to press and hold button to set your memorized position.





Put it closer to driver


Is not as accurate as the navigation system on mu I-phone or wife's Lexus
only opens partially when latch pulled
apparently a software glitch. took it to the dealership twice before it was fixed.
Left signal has a very fast paced click aound compared to the right. Occasionally the switch bounces back and i have to switch it on again before turming. Left headlight also remains on for couple mins after car is turned off. Will take to dealer next week.
I like having storage so that my things aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t in the open. My wallet barely fits underneath in the area but my car has the phone charger which I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t figured out how to use yet. Not a big enough issue to take to the dealer. Just new car changes that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m getting used too.
Mat slides everytime I get into the car since there isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a stopper. But once I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in and move it back I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t move around enough to be really bothered. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just a minor thing that could be fixed on the newer ones.
It might be higher than the dashboard and we can't seem to be able to pinpoint where it is coming from.
I don't think you should have to uncover the cup holders.
The sunroof was open with no problem but when i attempted to close. it would reopen. This continue for about 1 min .
when asking system to call name from contact it  never works properly.
 : Driver side seat belt does not retract when getting out of the car - gets caught in closing the door
Difficult to close with BMW book enclosed
Very tight, may loosen up with use
my ford vehicles' voice reco system are far/away superior to bmw's
not as big an issue - just being picky

should offer a variable speed with the auto button.doesn't seem fast enough when needed with heavy rain/snow.
sometimes the rear camera doesn't operate until you put the vehicle in forward again and then reverse.
I was recently advised by a tech that this feature is only activated at over 35 mph. it should be active at all speeds.
triangles are not bright or large enough
button difficult to find, should be along with heated seats - should stay on and not reset when turn off car.
it seems like it is loose, took to dealer said it is ok.still has issue.
too small, items do not stay in glovebox -
should be one lid, not a split lid.
only getting 16.X miles per gallon.
: The audio system sometimes defaults to the Satellite radio source even though the last source being used was the Preset, which includes Satellite, FM, and AM selections. This occurs after I return to the car after it has been off for awhile. It doesn't always occur which makes it seem like an electronic glitch. However, it may be a normal function and not a big enough issue to warrant a visit to the dealer.
You can barely tell that it is on even at the highest level.
Most performance car has this issue. Not a problem per say but would be great if BMW can find material that shed less dust while not sacrificing performance
Just find my bells going off regularly from door ajar.
It doesnt seem tight or sound.  This is my second BMW X5 in 3 years and this one isnt the quality as  the first.
I shut it and more the 2 times have found it still open again.  not fully open but partial
Outside noise is excessive when driving from the rear
There is a noise in driver seat at low speed when driving.  Also a squeek or rattle in rear seat when driving slow
Just isnt easy to shut
It looks to me that wheel was damaged on delivery trunk considering the location and general orientation of scratch and gouge. Dealership did tend to agree with that deduction.
sometimes sticks and hard to open completelyoften the foot unlock doesn't work
unlock button in inconvenient locationtruck keyless open doesn't always work
dont know how to work it
occasional
not sure which controls are for what
not sure which are which
not sure how to use
tall cups dont fit

Detest this feature.  Must turn it off every time I start car.  Have other BMW's which once turned off, you do not have to do it again.
This control is obstructed by other stuff on the steering column.  One needs to be able to use wipers quickly for safety.  Can't seem to.  Various controls and setting are confusing.
: rear taillight failure
Noted that as compared to my other car, the windows seem to have more condensation noted upon temperature fluctuations than my other car had.  It also takes longer for them to resolve or for he windows to ckear
: One of the back panels in the rear cargo area keeps popping off it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not fitted properly.  Noticed this on delivery and they noted it saying they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think it was a problem however said to contact them if it continued
bumper had a scratch
: I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if this is really a manufacturing issue. My hatch back stopped opening to the correct setting of height. I eventually found out that I needed to open it and manually push it up to the correct height.  After I did this it has not been a problem. I only noticed this after I had a ceramic coat applied to the exterior. I think the service person  may have manually pushed the hatch down creating the issue.
They are white seats so I am not surprised that that can get dirty very easily.
This is more of a design issue. When I have all the windows and sunroof open, the rear seatbelts slap against seats a lot. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve not experienced this issue in previous cars.
I took the car in because the light was not working.  They had to order a new light from Germany because there was water in the light.  They did give me a loaner for the time they had the car.
The check engine like came on about 2-3 weeks after delivery. After a day or so, it disappeared and since it was a new vehicle, we ignored the light. About a few months later, the same check engine light came on again and disappeared a day or so later again.


: After I start the car, the audio menu will switch randomly from pre set to pandora
after pulling out of garage, car tend to jump a little bit on first acceleration
No indication from vehicle, from the front or rear, in what should be alert situations to cross traffic.

Difficulty in getting vehicle to attempt parking in an obvious parallel parking opportunity. Still haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t successfully auto parallel parked. I have however been able to get the vehicle to perpendicular park once, and again, several parking opportunities were ignored by the vehicle


The steering wheel completely blocks my view of the instrument panel. I have to rely on heads up display instead
It blocks the view of the instrument panel
Per dealer these noises are normal due to the adaptive suspension. I am not convinced this is true
Wiper control are of a different design and appear inferior to wiper controls in my previous BMWs. This this my 5th 3 series.
Turn signal stalk are of a different design than all my previous BMWs. Appear to be not as well made and function differently from previous models
Passenger side mirror does not dim at night. This was standard on previous 3 series but was removed from 2018 models
Speedometer is completely blocked by the steering wheel


Dealer stated this due to wax being applied to door seals prior to the delivery It took two visits to service to reduce this noise to a somewhat acceptable level : Squeaking noises from door seals

Obey oversprayed the residual treatment and left stains on interior panel and exterior, they are working to tesolve
Noticed crack while washing car. It is inside the light were the plastic comes together.
There is a storage place left of steering wheel and the lever stopped holding the door closed.

The description of an action does not clearly explain what the action is.
The front cup holders are too close to the dash for tall cups.
I probably just haven't figured it out yet.
Truck blew up rock and chipped windshield.
Nav directions guided correctly until the last turn of the route. This was a one time occurrence.
Sounds like the seat has a basic loose but or needs lubrication to fix squeak as I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sitting in it and driving. Acceleration and deceleration cause it to make noise along with rocking back and forth. Have appt with dealership this next week to fix it.

Grasping the seat belt to pull it down - belt is so close to the side of the car its hard to grasp.  And the buckle  at least at times seems difficult to insert
Doesn't cool sufficiently unless I engage Max AC
Have to align contents just right to get the door to close
Engine shuts down smoothly -but at start up it sputters
Scratch windwo pillar molding, part received from dealer not installed yet.
Broken plastic seat track cover
: The audio/navigation system crashes and restarts occasionally while driving.
Vehicle was fixed, was a faulty compressor from the factory
: The speedometer is blocked by the wheel. Cannot see speed.
: It is too complicated for me to understand. Too much to remember. Maybe I am at fault, maybe it is not intuitive enough. Maybe both. It tries to do too much. Most of the features are unimportant to me and will never bemused. Just complicates the whole operation of the system.
Connectivity issues arise after i have rebooted my phone. Does not recognize phone immediately.
Passenger front seat belt when not in use rattles against side door molding on interior : If the seat belt clip on passenger fron side is not perfectly lined up it rattles against the plastic door molding. Is a design issue. Not sure dealer can do anything about it
Cup holders are too small and cannot put a square shaped water bottle in it such as Fiji water
It is hard to locate the opening.  I often have to look to find the insertion point.
There is not much space at all.  If I don't place the things in a particular way,  I can't get it closed.  This is the third 5 series I have owned, and this problem is new. This is a design issue, not a repairable thing.
not clear how to engage intermittent and also front vs rear
There is no indicator, that I can see, that indicates low fuel.  I was down to 19 miles left to go and still no indictor
Sometimes, upon starting/entering the vehicle, my phone is not discovered.
The base of the seatbelt should be an inch higher.  It is difficult to buckle because the base is too low
The side storage compartment won't stay closed.  Latch no longer catches.
The holder mechanism within the cup holder is very stiff and you need to twist the cup to insert.
I initially noticed the blemish within 10 minutes of leaving the dealership.  I had the window replaced 2 times. I am currently on my 3rd windshield and this one also has a blemish.  The 5 series that I had as a loner vehicle also had a blemish in the windshield.  All were manufactured by Carlex.

Hrd to regulate to get proper temp
Sometimes street names are reported incorrectly even though the directions are correct.  Sometimes when emerging from parking lots the GPS does not correctly locate the car.

The system may not always pair the audio media at the first attempt.  Always on the second attempt it works.
Idrive system completely failed : Idrive system completely failed.
Idrive system completely failed. : Idrive system completely failed.

: Problem using gesture control to change volume on radio

Told it to call one number which it did, then tried to call a second number and it keep calling the first number.   After three attempts I gave up
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve already provided details in previous responses. : There is a noise that is constant at all speeds.  It interferes with the radio at a normal volume.  It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not wind noise from mirrors, doors , moonroof.  It is not the engine noise, tire noise.    Our service tech has heard the noise,bit cannot identify it.  We have been to the dealer numerous times, they can not identify and fix the problem.
Have to angle containers in and out of cup holders.  This is a design issue.

From delivery, pressing the SOS button for BMW Assist didn't work, nothing happened.  I finally had to take the car to BMW service, and they had to install a new version of the car's software.
Bluetooth connection drops up to five times per day, sometimes only once per day.
Bluetooth bluetooth bluetooth. Keeps dropping. : On-going issues with losing the Bluetooth connection to my iPhone.

As above.  Multiple insignificant movements by me cause the tailgate to open at very inopportune times.
I think the paint is just extremely fragile such that even the slightest trauma causes it to chip off.
Not tall enough to be helpful.  More for decoration
Way too sensitive.  Too many controls do the same thing and interfere with one another, especially with rear tailgate.  Also door handle touching that lock and unlock the doors is very hit or miss.
I am still not certain that I understand the nature of this feature or that I have seen it work.  However the icon comes up periodically on my dashboard.
beeps all the time, when I park, when I go into my garage, sometimes while driving.  It is just too sensitive.
very annoying when I am driving.  Unlike many other features, I was able to turn it permanently off.
Navigation system often gets commands wrong.
It connects to bluetooth but doesn't connect to my Pandoria or Spotify apps.


The odor is probably from the different epoxy, sprays, glues that are used for different purposes. I can not sit in the vehicle without opening a window. It causes me to cough.

The collision avoidance/alert system would go off even if there was no one around me. After speaking with the dealer, they said it was a known issue and a problem with the settings. Meanwhile, my car is randomly breaking/stopping while I'm driving down the street.
the passenger seat has a pull out leg extension. unfortunately, it doesn't stay closed and opens whenever it wants.


The car gets chipped easily from normal driving
It probably normal, but wanted to mention it.
When it Auto mode it doesn't get very cool.
Cannot see it when wearing sunglasses.
re: the front center cup holder - the liquid in an open cup often sloshes out into the open space in front of it where the USB port is, getting anything in the open space wet
: This has happened twice:  car will be parked on a hill .  Turn car on, it will move an inch and then jerk to a stop, like it believes there is an obstacle it doesn't want to hit.  Then it won't move, either forward or backward.  Both times, car eventually moved after what seemed like a long time but was probably only 4 or 5 minutes.  Once I called the dealer for help but by the time I got routed to a person, it moved.  Never figured out why it happened.
The doors lock after unlocking them when you exit vehicle to go open other doors.
trying to increase zoom, but automatically resets back.  cannot see written text of directions, or cannot find how to see it.  too difficult to use while driving.

When the owner's manual is placed in the glove box, it is difficult to close .

All aspects of park assist gives warning and does not work.
I took it in starting the first week for multiple times. They don't know what is wrong with it. They have kept the car over night, changed parts, and still can not fix it. The last time they said that they are going to call BMW.
The collision avoidance alert system has been un-operative from day one. I have taken it to the dealership, and they don't know how to fix it.
The front of the car has no space. For those that travel a lot, it is a poorly designed car in the interior. Nothing that the dealer can do.
very poorly designed car with very little space.
It is very small for anything other than a can or a small bottled water. There is nothing that the dealer can do, because it is a design flaw.
One wiper just smeared and did not clear the windshield. It was replaced and now operates properly.
Not quite the exterior. It's the door sill plate with the ///M logo. There's a scratch about 2 inches long across the ///M logo. The plate looks to be aluminum. Sent picture to dealer and they agreed to handle it when I bring in the car for the break-in oil change, which hasn't happened yet.Also, a quarter inch of the rubber seal along the passenger window was caught underneath the plastic trim that it overlays. I just had to dislodge it so it'd sit over the plastic trim. But, now this a noticeable pinch in that rubber seal. Maybe it'll expand back to normal after some time. Disappointing, but not a big deal.
I frequently have to reconnect my phone before making a phone call.


It is subtle.  Comes and goes.  I can't exactly pinpoint when and where.
It is difficult to close. I was told by salesman that it must be slammed to make sure it is shut all the way. I don't think I should have to do that for the latch to catch. 
The sealant 'goo' was on the door surface. At delivery I was told this would eventually come off. After 2 car washes, snow, rain and trying to wipe, I ended up taking back to dealer to have them remove with a solvent.
The passenger side does not wipe clean. It is as if the wiper is not touching the windshield on the outer right part. I experienced when the windshield was dirty/salty. I am not sure if it happens during regular rain since water is clear.
The center console should have a knotch for the AUX cord. The 'next' song button is small and located on the dash, it should be on the steering wheel. I have not been able to mirror my android phone. At first I had music on a USB drive that I would shuffle through the different songs/albums, now it doesn't shuffle anymore even though the shuffle option is selected.
If the port is located inside the console, there should be a knotch where the cord comes out instead of the lid just being closed on top of the cord pinching it. The USB port interferes with storage in the center console. It sticks out into storage area.
The interstate was rerouted 2 years ago in my city, however the programming does not reflect it. Google maps already reflects the change in the streets. The dealer said it was not their problem.
It only goes outward into back down low, not high enough.
When I had the windows open, the seat belt on front passenger side moved in the wind hitting the inside of the car frame.
At about 200 miles the engine light went on . The following day I took it in and the dealer had it for 1 week. It took them 2 days to figure out what the problem was and then they had to order part. It turns out it was the DEF sensor and the entire tank had to be replaced. 


The liftgate is supposed to open with my foot and its tricky. Sometimes it doesnt work.
: The hood was misaligned. I took it back and it was fixed immediately. No issue
I got Apple Car Play and it was not working properly. It would stop working . I took the car back twice and now it has been working for about a week. Hopefully the problem is resolved.


This is my third BMW X3 and I still don't understand how to work the A/C
the back seats do not recline at all and are very uncomfortable.... like the back seat of a full sixe 4 seater truck
I have a Florida drawl, voice recognition doesn't always understand the address or name of place requested. If I speak loud, clear, and slow it helps. It hasn't really been a problem. Annoying at most.
This is my second i3.  I previously leased a 2015 i3.  I have owned BMWs for many years.  The voice recognition system is definitely improving but still is less reliable than Siri with regard to instructions.
Engine light identified a problem with what I think was the controller of electrical energy flow.  BMW had to remove the batteries to access the part which took a few weeks.  .  I frankly don't understand what was malfunctioning since it did not appear to affect the performance of the car and I don't yet understand the details of electrical vehicle systems.
The system stopped working a month after purchase.
I did
The motorized adjustment just started cycling back and forth through the range without passenger attempt to adjust.  It continued until the car was shut off.  Has not yet happened a second time.



System cancels and come up on its own


.
It is located in the center consul and requires the driver to get in the car first before unlocking all other doors for the passengers.
Difficult to get the hatch to open using the foot movement.  Often requires several  tries before the hatch opens.
There is a small chip on the driver door, which appears to be the result of opening the door against another vehicle or wall.

The control is not visible from the seat and hard to locate,
Brake rotors were replaced by another BMW dealership. They were rusted from sitting on the lot. No problems since rotors were replaced.
Plastic trim on B-Pillars along with other trim Creak/Squeak quite loudly on sunny days.


it appears to be awkwardly shaped
The drivers seat and steering wheel has deep scuff marks.
Navigation screen flickering repeatedly.
The air conditioning system seems inadequate.   It takes a while to get the car cooled off.    the air conditioning does not blow out cold air for quite a while.   The air is only mildly cool at first.
poor location
I FIND THE CUP HOLDER IS TOO FAR FORWARD FROM THE DRIVER. IT IS DIFFICULT TO TAKE A QUICK SIP WHILE WAITING AT A STOP LIGHT.
Every time I get into the car my legs hit the controls and I have to reset it each time, the controls needs to be in a lower location.
The tailgate will sometimes not fully open when the handle is pressed
Too sensitive to touch...difficult to get it to stop blinking after a lame change has been made and I try to turn it off.
Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t figure out how to unlock all doors, lock all doors and use the door handle touch feature
Phonebook connection erratic and inexplicable
Too complicated to use. Too many steps. It is a design issue. Nothing the dealer can do.
The 3D View of BMW Connect did not work. Gave an error message to the effect that a security token was missing. In order to solve this issue, the entire operating system had to be reloaded. This caused new gremlins that have not been totally resolved. Steering Assist does not work properly. Drifts from one side of the lane to the other, and then turns itself off. Not ready for prime time. Have taken this issue to dealer and they say that this is as good as it gets. Evidently a poor design.
Navigation system voice recognition worked very well until the operating system was updated/changed to address BMW Connect not working properly. Following the update, the Nav system has made errors pulling addresses of of the phone contact list. One time took me to an address that wasn't even in the phone or car's contact list. I am hopeful that this is case of different keywords in the changed operating system and I will get it to work properly. Nav can still be used via the mechanical controls.
: The SOS call feature did not work at all. SOS call button was dead. Nothing happened when pressed. This was repaired by dealer
I had taken the vehicle to the dealership about the issue. Unfortunately the person who tested it at that time did not experience the issue. However, the vehicle continues to pull
The Bluetooth just won't pair my cellphone to the system in the vehicle
Abnormal loud noise can be heard especially when vehicle just starts up

Did not notice scratch upon delivery.  Scratch was found after a week or so.
Have had to reset the date three times. Has been reported to BMW customer service..
Does not work very well
Hesitation when restarting. I just disabled the feature
Not able to operate door handle touch opening convenience with key in pocket.  Confusing number of key presses required to open all doors at once.
We bought the car after dark and forgot to look over the vehicle before leaving the dealership.  Once we got home under the garage lights we saw that there was a small dent in the hood.  We did not take this problem to the dealer because we knew there was no way to prove it did not happen on that way home.  Our fault for not looking over the vehicle before leaving the dealer.
There is no 'problem' per say.  I've just driven much quieter luxury cars.  I was surprised at how much I had to turn up the radio to understand the person talking on the radio when I went over 60.
: There was ONE isolated incidence where the passenger's window was too high when we shut the door for some reason.  It bowed the glass out but we opened the door, started the car and rolled that window down and back up again and everything was as normal after that.  I'm not sure why the window was up too high when it tried to shut at that time.  We had just rolled down the window previous to that incidence.  But since it did not happen again, we did not take the vehicle in for service.
If I'm listening to a LIVE stream of a news app such as Fox News or our local news station and get into my car, it will not play the news app live stream audio through the car speakers like other vehicles I have had do.
With large drinks being such an American trend, the cup holders need to be further away from the dash.  Large drinks  constantly rub the dash because they won't fit in straight without hitting the dash behind the cup holders.
: I assume someone in the wash bay either used a dirty towel or need to retrain because some of the  were clearly scratched and I went for a knee replacement the very next morning I brought the car and finished the sale at midnight the night before, I live 2 miles away and had 3 weeks to look at it before driving so I definitely saw all the floss.


: The turn signal would flash the opposite direction after pulling the turn stick back into neutral position.
while plugging in car at charging station noticed very large bubble on sidewall.  Car has not hit potholes or any other road issues.
: The seat is too tall for normal height passengers under 6 ft..  Headrest is too high and does not support neck well.
: The seat is too tall for normal height passengers under 6 ft..  Headrest is too high and does not support neck well.
Shifting down to first at stop signs has a lurch.
I have always liked the tight handling of the BMWs.  I'm finding that the 3-series handling is looser than my M4 and what I recall from my older BMW 330 .   I do not believe this to be due to any defect but rather how the car is designed.

the car is loud
: at night, the turn signal lights on the side mirrors are so bright and placed so poorly that it blinds me
I have to lower the steering wheel so much so I can see all the controls on the dashboard that the steering wheel is almost in my lap!

lane departure warning is poorly designed- it is on the dashboard and 'jiggles' the steering wheel.
commands are rejected with car saying something like 'voice activation not available at this time'
apple car play would not work at dealership and I was sent home to address the issue with Apple. I went to the internet and resolved the issue. However, carplay does not work consistently, nor does the bluetooth connection to my device. I have to pari my phone frequently.

DUE TO IT BEING NEW
TOOK TO DEALER THEY SAID BECAUSE IT IS NEW
 : when adjustment to length for feet room it tends to click in place after the fact and sometimes while your driving the seat will move.
The height adjustment to raise seat is difficult due to the fact you literally have to get out of the car to do it or lift yourself up off the seat.



honestly I GOT TIRED OF GOING TO DEALER FOR EVERY LITTLE THING DOORS ..SEATS..ETC
constant scuffing marking from people entering and departing vehicle.

Misinterprets commands.

Auto function is difficult to understand.Sync - always needs to be pressed after restarting the cr


: Auto shut off turns off too quickly - IE does;t wait for the car to fully stop - think slowing down at a red light and just before you stop, the engine stops - and you could have inched forward just a bit.

: trunk opens by itself-unsure if triggered by key, but found it open at least 3x while it was parked




don't know how to describe, but emits foul odor
The system is 'clunky'.  It doesn't interpret name/address/city or starts down a different name than is given.



Musty smell. Believe it may be from the interior sealant package that was bought after market from dealer
: There have been a couple of times when trying to enter addresses in the navigation system that it does not provide accurate results or does not let me complete the address.
Primarily on the drivers door, and to a far lesser degree on the passenger side door, noticed a bit of 'sticky material' stuck to the low outside corner of the doors. Something had dripped from the inside of the doors down the small  are at the base of the doors. The dealer indicated that this was a wax  that is used inside the door panel and that the heat may have melted a bit of excess.  I was encouraged to remove it myself using hot water on a cloth.
Does not readily recognize the appropriate phone device.
Handbrake wont hold under all conditions. Seems very week.
I previously owned a 2011 X5 and you could barely hear the road noise outside.  With this new model you hear everything
there is some type of yellow oil like substance coming out from various openings in the vehicle mainly the doors and trunk
it does not understand me when I say an address i have to repeat it a couple of time and then it understnads
this noise happens on and off and with various conditions.  I just turn the radio up and tune it up. hopefully it is not serious :)
the design luggage cover is just strange you have to pull under and then up..who thought that was a good idea
the older model had a button to press so i did not need to reach all the way over the passenger seat to open the glove box, plus it had more space
even with the windshield clean there is a type of film over it.  I see this in my other vehicles   and thought ha!! they are using the cheap stuff.  Clearly I was wrong as it now happening to my car.  Again the 2011 X5 I had did not have this problem
it does this on and off
When I open the driver door to get out, many times it comes right back and closes.  This happens especially when it is windy, the door blows shut and it is difficult to reopen.I try to park in a spot where there is no vehicle on my driver side so that I can open the driver door the whole way when I am trying to exit the vehicle.  As a female, I open the door, reach over to get my purse on the passenger seat and then begin to exit the door.  Many times, the door has moved back to the closed position and I have to reopen it and try to move past the steering wheel with my purse, or other bags.
I want to open my sunroof just enough to get air moving in the vehicle.  When I push the button that I can reach, the sunroof tilts up and the sunshade moves back just a little bit.  I want to open the sunshade and roof a little more but when I press the button again, it opens the whole way. I have difficulty getting it to open part way.
My passenger needed to adjust the headrest and could not do it from a seated position.  I was driving and not able to stop and adjust it for my passenger.
paint not reaching to top of vehicle, need to take to dealership so they can see.
: I'm short, and it would be great if the driver seat adjusted a little higher
I just started using the AC.  The blower is loud when the AC is on high.
usually during my first drive of the day, might be because of handbreak

Rear window defroster worked poorly to melt snow
: speedometer is off by about 3 mph
cup holders are too far forward under the dashboard in the front seat making it difficult to use and won't allow medium to large cups
BMW brakes have always been very linear and direct and I feel that the brakes on this new vehicle have been softened up which other manufactures have done. I've owned 4 previous BMW vehicles as well as currently owning a Porsche and feel the new X3 brakes have been compromised from the previous well connected feel. I realize I'm not the typical SUV driver so my opinion is a bit biased.
The system incorrectly reports the tire pressures.
Front passenger seatbelt rattles when not in use.
STAYS ON SAME TEMP

I have difficulty in divorcing my iPhone from the in-car system.  It's probably because I don't yet know how to manipulate them.
I think this feature makes the car feel 'squishy.'  I turn it off.
It should be a little larger. It is awkward.

doesnt happen all the time
the pillow from the passenger seat and the back of it

sounds like parts are loosen and falling apart

White seats - I had additional protection applied by dealership - but still very difficult to keep clean and to get clean
Cargo area scuffs easily - the rear cargo concealment device is poorly designed and is difficult to deploy retract without scuff surrounding rear cargo area
the part that covers the manual key entry had a broken piece that attached it to vehicle. It fell off in the garage. Dealership replaced with another on the lot.
The center console scratches ridiculously easily.
When I give an address it always gets it wrong. Waste of time and effort!
touch screen would be much better
The car has really big brake pads that are really soft because it is a performance car, so they leave a lot of dust.
It sometimes takes me 2-3 times to have my hand unlock the rear doors after gripping handle
I have to slam the the middle console cover hard to get it to stay closed
The auto shutoff causes jerks when shutting off or on, making a less smooth ride
Car play not interacting well with the internal BMW audio system and casue the system volume to shut. : Apple Car play do not interact greatly with the BMW system.  Anytime touching the carplay, the audio system stops working and need to turn the volume on to hear again.
 : Engine shut down with no reason as part of the eco option that turn the engine off.  Engine shut down before i get to full stop at a traffic light, engine shutdown when I go slow into my garage. Eco option isn't performing and very annoying.I can't cancel it the autoshut off and keep it.  Everytime need to push the cancel botton.
: Text messages from iPhone is not displayed while it did work with my Samsung
The trim is coming off, i am able to pull it up.
The vents are in the middle therefore it is sometimes difficult to cool down the back seats
The glove box is small and there should be additional compartments to separate items.
The storage bin is very small and does not allow for sufficient storage for additional items.
The cup holders are too close and if the cup is tall it is difficult to remove.
removing crossbar and reinstalling works, but is cumbersome
: The feature wherein you can open the rear hatch by waving your foot under the rear bumper almost never works. This feature does work randomly but seldomly. This issue was recognized at delivery but in view of the fact that everything else works perfectly I have made no complaint.
The control to lower/raise the headrest is on the side of the seat along with other seat controls. It's not specifically called out, and is just another button with the other seat buttons that have been there for quite some time. Just seems like an odd place to put that button. Again, not a problem just a design flaw.
First the rear seats need to be moved forward to their maximum setting manually or the 3rd row seats are unable to be pulled up and locked in place. The pull up straps for the 3rd row are hard to reach if smaller. In both the Mercedes Benz GLS and the Audi Q7 the 3rd row seats are automatically operated via switch, which is easy to locate and operate. It also does not require the 2nd row seats to be moved significantly for them to be erected or folded flat, both of which are done through a single push/pull button. It's not a problem so much as a design flaw or 'afterthought enhancement' that wasn't well engineered or human factors engineering applied.
Have not had time to study manuel or visit Wizard at dealer
Not had time to study manuel or visit Dealership Wizard.
Have not had time to study manuel or visit Wizard at dealership.
I pull in address for home and when I use nav it always directs me to way out of the way driving to get to a straight home.  The route is straight and quickest and even when I ignore the route it selects it keeps putting me on the bad route - no way it needs to direct me this way.
normal air is warm - never cold unless you hit air max
: The tailgate has sometimes popped open--the button on the key fob was very sensitive.  It has been remedied by only being activated if the car is open.
I believe the problems arise from my phone and not from the car's system
Control key fob, nor inside door button control, open the rear hatch with one press as they should.  One press only unlocks the hatch .  I have to press them multiple times to get the hatch to swing open.  I will be taking it back to the dealer to be repaired.
The air has to be on MAX to cool the vehicle when the outside temp is 80+ degrees, or it's humid.  When it's on regular cooling, i.e. set to a temp of 73 degrees or lower, air blows but it does not cool.  This is another item on my list to take back to the dealer.
Both systems have difficulty at time with 2-syllable names where each syllable is a word i.e. parkmoore becomes E Park or Morewood... It's a reproducible issue nearly 100% of the time
I am not sure whether it is a 'problem' or normal for this vehicle with run flat tires.
I feel like I need to study the system operation more to really comment.  However, I do feel that the map is either too far out thus vague with respect to ancillary roads or when 'dialed in' at medium range poor street name markings.  I need to dial in really close to get street names which is great but then I can't see where I am going to the map.
Bought Car with a problem tire which was replaced and then the replacement went flat.
The storage compartment to the lower left of the steering wheel is somewhat flimsy - not as solid as all other components.  I use it for my sunglasses, but sometimes it won't close properly if I do not put my sunglasses in it in a specific way.  This is really the only place to store sunglasses. It is a design issue that should be explored.
The cup holder works well it is just in an inconvenient location.
the brake pedal appears to be small and your foot could easily slip off it
i cannot figure out how to open the sunroof all the way
Keyless entry some times they work when you grab the door handle and sometimes I cannot get them to work.  Will take to dealer
: the speakers do not sound great.
I may have mis-read the question.  The carpet floor mats for the front drive and passenger side are small and do not cover the area properly.  I guess this is standard now with BMW
I could not figure out how to open the sun roof all the way.  Different from my last BMW.  I will be taking it to the dealer as it may be defective
Shiny black material used on the center console and aluminum looking trim on the dash and doors.  Apparently due to the finishes
The space in the center console is virtually non-existent.  Also the padded arm rest top of the unit should have some means of locking or clicking in place.  When you enter the vehicle and slide into the seat, supporting yourself on the arm rest, it moves annoyingly.
The in door storage pockets could be better designed for better and more useable space.
The sun roof was very heavily lubricated with grease.  Whenever it was opened, the smell of grease was overwhelming.
Transmission control module had to be replaced, was in the shop for 3 weeks for this.  Now it is at the dealer to have the transmission replaced.  Both had to be special ordered from Germany. : Drivetrain malfunction -- transmission.
See previous page. : Drivetrain malfunction -- transmission.
Grumbling/groaning noise especially noticeable when transmission shifted from 2nd to third gear, but also apparent at other shift points.
can't find my home address

When in auto climate, the fan will suddenly speed up then slow down.  Like it can't find the appropriate speed.  There's a sight clicking noise when the fan is running
Primary problem is with using my phone.  Voice recognition does not recognize or can't find the correct phone number or states that voice recognition is not available at this time

It appears that there is insufficient temperature of the air to cool down the car.
: The rear trunk has popped open by itself a few times when outside of the car, but without pressing the key fob button or putting my foot under the back of the car .  I have yet to determine why this is happening or advised the dealer yet.  It has happened about four times since delivery.
: The control panel  was at times clicking through the menus on its own.  Primarily after the car was driven in the sun for a while.  It can only be described as a ghost clicking through the various menus, and could only be stopped by turning off the control display.  I took it to the dealer and this was a defect they were aware of.  The CID had to be replaced.  Their tech bulletin also referred to the problem as 'Ghost Clicking'.
The front storage is very poor in this car.  Also, taking away the small box to the left of the steering wheel was a bad idea, further decreasing the available storage.
glove box too small
The car battery was dead at delivery and needed a replacement installed. The dealer took care of this quickly.
The wheels quickly look dirty

Apple car play does not function logically or smoothly
I simply struggle to get the temperature to a comfortable level and keep it there
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s noisy





It feels very unstable at high speed



AC suddenly stopped working, was recently repaired : It warms too much with the eco driving, auto shut off
Only the seat back rest feels cool but not cold. The seat bottom never feels cool/cold.
The leather, when exposed to air or water, has a foul odor. This happened in my previous X5 and I thought it was the Nappa leather. However, it's happening with the Individual leather in the current X5.
The silver molding fell off.....not sure when it happened
The fact these don't extend is a mystery. Very short sighted.

It is very inconsistent and alarms for no apparent reason sometimes but does not trigger when I cross a lane intentionally. It overall does not work very well.

It does not seem to get cool enough and I have to use max cool setting
This seems to randomly be activated and deactivated. Frustrating because you begin to get use to it and realize you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t always trust that it is working.
: Randomly the audio system selects Pandora I spend the next minute reselecting FM as it continues to fight me and go back into Pandora. Very frustrating and a distraction form the road.
: AC occasionally has an unpleasant smell.
The system does not always understand my command and/or address I'm providing.
My music doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t connect to the Bluetooth and won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t play s track It automatically goes to some random song
It started squeaking after some time.
It squeaks especially after it rains.
At delivery, there is a blemish on the passenger side.
The radio has poor reception in certain areas where I drive.
: Auto liftgate from rear of car stopped working
covered above
Too much required effort to keep the vehicle straight on freeways
: Pandora app freezes occasionally in car.  Bluetooth works great but cannot do the screen pairing.
Pandora app freezes occasionally in car.  Bluetooth works great but cannot do the screen pairing.
already staining black 
The squeaking is a known problem that has to do with the door seals and the trim, especially cars with the shadow line trim.
The rear swinging doors can make it hard to get things in and out of the back seat as they trap you in when you park next to something.


some scratchs, also under front  car.
Is just a sound sometimes when I use the breaks.
to select an application like Spotify is very very slow to react the commands. The dealer said this is the way it is now.
It's cumbersome and doesn't always recognize words.
The Apple Car play, when addressing text messages, will continue to talk and talk and talk and talk when I have picked the phone up to key in a message.  I'm already responding so, the systems repeating itself if frustrating and the WORST part of this car.  Also, you should have the option to completely disable the text message preview on the screen of the car but leave it on your phone so all my girlfriends don't see the other ones texting.
The manual package/leather pouch will not fit in the glove box.  The box is also not deep enough to put things in.  It also needs a lip so things don't fall out when you open the door.
It just shuts down to early at a stop sign when you are off the throttle and at very low speeds.  If you go back to the throttle it re-fires but the car is still rolling at just under 1mph so it's a rough and uncomfortable moment.  These systems should be addressed by the dealer upon delivery giving the consumer the option to disable them.  They are liberal garbage.
I am finding difficulty in understanding how to operate delay wipers.
I was not shown how to turn on my heated steering wheel. I live in New York and because I bought my SUV in Florida, I feel it may have been an oversight because of the different  climates and the lack of need for it in Florida.

see earlier comment : wind whistle through door windows
Always drops the first time you try to make a call.  Second attempt is usually successful.  Car inhibits phone from speaking navigation from maps apps.   Won't come through speaker in cars nor through the phone.  Essentially can't use maps app on phone while in the car unless you disconnect from the car
There is a delay from pushing the gas pedal till the car takes off.  Dangerous when crossing traffic.  Must account for the delay
The A/C will suddenly stop cooling for a few seconds. Usually this occurs during high temps outside and it appears to struggle to keep cool. It occurs usually one to three times during a 30 minute drive
Noticed the scratched molding the first time I washed the car.  There is nothing that could have happened between the time I bought it and then.


Can't adjust the height of the seat belt.

There are two places about the size of a pin head where the paint does not cover the primer completely.
: The day of the month would skip forward a day every ten days to two weeks. The first software update did not fix it but the second update did.
Scratch on trunk
appears to have closed but dash signals it is still open; I stop and close again
sometimes it will close correctly and sometimes it takes several minutes to get it to close; appears not to alignonce I had to drive without it closed; another time another motorist signaled me that it was open

Doesn't appear to operate correctly
Takes a stiff brush to get anything off seats; they appear to pick up anything from lint to paper and difficult to get off. Cars I've had before only require a quick brush of the hand to get anything off of seats
Technical difficulties connecting non-iphones to car




The door does not automatically open when you place your foot underneath the car which makes finding the right location for opening difficult when you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re holding bags.

Windshield becomes foggy and it becomes difficult to see.

Got stuck in icy conditions
: I would like to be able to balance the speakers front/back and there doesn't seem to be a way to do that.
The plastic was scratched

Squeaks when pulling down
 : Seatbelt jams and does not retract
Small wrinkle in the fabric to driver-side left between front and driver side window.
Hood release has to be repeatedly pumped even after the release pop noise.

First drive of the day - backing out and down my driveway 
The voice recognition sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't despite the same commands.

iPhone lost connection 3 times early on, I had to go through the pairing routine to reconnect.  This has not occurred in the last several weeks.
System took me to the wrong location even though address input was accurate.
It's just a little annoying, i'm used to my BMW X5 and it's an entirely different machine.
Center console menu difficult to switch between satellite and radio and iPhone content
At first I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that I had to press the hatch opener twice. Even after I realized that, it sometimes requires an extra press in order to open.
I find the audio system not at all intuitive and often give up trying to program or preset. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been back to the dealer for re-clarification with only moderate success. Also HD stations often fade out, with a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìlost signal√¢‚Ç¨¬ù message, although I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not sure if that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the fault of the Mini Cooper audio system or possibly the locations I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m traveling into and out of.
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just confusing. Setting up the pre-set/favorite channels is odd and I have not yet figured it out. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not very intuitive.
Not too complicated but.   Does not. Consistently open automatically with foot swipe kick under hatch
I.       Am.  Slow.  And.  Super busy at work....no time to research how to set up default for no heads up screen when using my keys - husband loves it but he has his own keys - keeps telling me i have to manually set this..
I need to make.  A. Second date was invited by Dallas my rep, but have not had time to research .... husband hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been able to adjust either - his phone and Bluetooth works fine....mine doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t :(
Seat movement difficult
Sounds like in the vicinity of the window
I recieved Two car keys for my Mini Countryman and was told each key had its own memory and would adjust to its owners preferences. For example how the driver likes their seat and favorite radio stations etc but was never told how to set up my key to what benefits me.
: A few times while driving the fasten seat belt alert will come on and keep going, even though I have my seat belt on and no one is in the passenger seat. I took a video of this and will tell the dealer about it when I go for my 1st service. It's done it maybe 4 times in 3 months.
Not too crazy about the shape or feel of button, it is okay. It would be nice to unlock when handle is pulled to entry vehicle.
Vehicle pulled to the right on the way home and the 1st week of owning it.  I made sure to pay attention to different road conditions and double check tire pressure before acquiring at dealership.  Dealership resolved.
A lever to lower seats from the rear cargo would be helpful
Texture seems to cause this but easily buffs out with lotion

The bottom of the trunk/bumper makes squeaky noises when force is applied.
The windows still roll down even if pressed on the lock button.
Clock should be displayed somewhere noticeable and easy to be seen.The number fonts are a little too small.

Wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t open in subzero temperature and subsequently broke
The brakes have occasionally pulled, as if the pads were still breaking in
Difficult to drive with size 9w workboots

Recirculate button won't stay 'on', turns itself off after 10 seconds
: the touch screen, nav and audio system just spontaneously shut down. but restarted when I restarted the car.
: The profile selections do not all save to my profile even though I keep doing it.

A lot of dust maybe change the brand of brake pads or put better pads on


Ac line was broken
Supposed to adjust button ring on which key fob is in the car but it doesn't do that
Leaked from ac line
: Ac line leaked inside
I am dropping  my mini at the dealership on Monday to have my 4th run flat tire replaced. I or my wife has wasted 7hours waiting for replacement and assume  that we waste another few hours taking the car in for service e. WILL NOT RECOMMEND A MINI UNLESS THE TIRES ARE CONVENTIONAL.

I'm not sure I am using it correctly, it never understand what address I am speaking about
I tend to use my phone still, it is faster and easier to use. I find the Nav system doesn't understand my commands and if I use the manual application, it takes forever .
It hasn't happened since I switched to brand name gas stations and stopped using an independently owned gas station.
See previous answer about changing gas stations
PASS SIDE BREAK LIGHT  NEED TO BE REPLACED
: Using the foot to open hatch is glitchy. Sometimes it opens without any issues on first try. Sometimes it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t open or takes many tries.
: Rattling of and some extra wind noise through dual moonroof.
: Rattling of and some extra wind noise through dual moonroof.
Engine isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t as smooth at takeoff as it should be; could just be turbo lag.
Can be slow in responding

: the rubber molding along the car wheel wells and bottom are a plastic material that show marks.  Like water marks etc It never looks clean even if it is.
Hard to reply to my situation with these choices.  I noticed that a small part  piece to my wiper blade seems like it came from another car.  My paint on the wiper itself is black flat  the very end like 4 inches on one blade only has metal flake in it. like shiny  ??? obviously belongs on a different car
: Sometimes the phone connect has a very loud screetch sound sometimes when I go to make a call..  Also the volume seems to different between phone calls and radio  one is soft one is loud.
side sun visor is way too short.  Does not block the sun. There is a large space where the visor could have been extended several inches to accomodate this problem
Noise occurs when sun/moonroof is fully open. If I open a side window slightly, it diminishes the noise, but, otherwise, it is distracting. It isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a mechanical issue. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a design issue, I believe.
Many incorrect suggestions when trying to access a particular person or place. EXTREMELY annoying, as well as very distracting!
: When I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m stopped st a light or for some other reason/ ie.traffic, if the engine shuts off, as it is supposed to, the air conditioning slows down significantly.  I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t imagine what it will do during the summer, here in Arizona! It might get quite hot!
More than expected scuffing on door panels. Probably from my entering/ or leaving the vehicle. Sometimes I have to use my shoe as a doorstop, so my foot doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get caught on the door√∞≈∏Àú∆í
Order of how controls operate is poor. Seems like the off control should be first or last, but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s strangely second.
Control sits on left side below steering wheel. Have to completely look away from road to see.
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s blocked by transmission shifter plus it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s difficult to see. If there is a drink in cup holder, tough to access.
: Sometimes saved settings all stop being saved without warning.
The rear kick open is a great idea, but hard to master, especially with full hands on 1 foot.The inside close and lock buttons are on the tail so youhave to be 5 feet to use.  Would be more convenient on the side so children coukd use it too.
Doors are fine, but we were upset bc we asked about the side tor the plug doorand were told front right.  It is front lett.  We had an electrical pkug put it for the front right and now needto drag the cord around the front to plug in.
We figured it out but took a bit of time. : A number of features were hard to learn and the initial tech visit was rushed.
Was told by dealer the the function isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that useful as you need 24 feet to park the 6 foot car. : A number of features were hard to learn and the initial tech visit was rushed.
iPhone connectivity is poor.  I find better user interface in our Dodge.  Really the only feature I think Mini should improve as a pure saftty measure.
: The left rear passenger door - small container in the door has a small clip that came loose and doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go back into place.  Haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t had time to go to dealership but making a appointment.
Tire popped and went flat after 2500 miles : Tire popped at 2500 miles
We keep trying to set this for each driver  and it does not retain the inforamtion
There is a rubbing sound when you brake at low speeds and the brakes are very sensitive.
: The horn is not loud enough

The vehicle would not charge at all. The dealer rebooted the system and it works fine.
: Tailgate is difficult to open when using the 'hands-free' sensor under the car
Apparently common occurnece with minis - it's an electrical issue saying there are drivee train issues 
The automatic wiper function is on by default.  This causes periodic wiper activity that may not be as the driver wants.  Additionally, the control for the wiper is located in a place where it is difficult to see and adjust while driving.
There needs to be a center selection for the mirror adjustment toggle.  This would lock the mirrors from getting inadvertently bumped while reaching for window controls.  I have regularly mistakenly adjusted either the left or right mirror because there is no way to set the adjustment toggle to 'no choice'.  Left or Right are the only options.
Would like to have a separate clock display.  There are too many times that I am driving and simply wish to glance at the clock for time.  The clock shown in the driver's panel is very small and takes concentrated effort to view and understand.  the Center Media console does not consistently display the clock.
First, the display itself is difficult to adjust - you must step through several menus to find the correct adjustment choice, then spin the selector 'mouse' to make this adjustment.  Second: The display is difficult to see when the steering wheel is fully raised.  As a shorter person, the display has to be at the top for me - yet it needs to be lower for my spouse since she raises the steering wheel to the topmost setting.Third: When wearing UV filtered sunglasses, the heads-up display is very difficult to see - even when set to maximum brightness.
It's a RAGTOP...not at all unexpected and  completely acceptable compared to other convertibles I've owned over the years.
tailgate is difficilt to open with under car foot motion
the problem may be mine.......i don't understand the system!
i do not understand the system!

Easily chipped from contact.


The wind noise is very loud in side the car once high speeds are reached.
It is loud inside the car once mid to high speeds are reached, especially when deriving on not perfectly paved roads.
The system takes a long time to register once a device is plugged into the Aux cable.
Some difficulty with apple car play and have had a couple of random radio reboots
It was a hum when certain songs were playing at higher volume levels. It was fixed with a single trip to the dealer. It was a loose speaker grill.
It's probably me. You should have more instruction on youtubes. I don't have time to go into the car sales place. I work full time; in fact all the time.
you can't easily wipe it off. The texture must absorb.
already said
 : Phone will not pair with car
part of the window has fallen off, will take to dealer soon

I have to put the temp to 64-66 F to get it cold. It takes time to get cold.
The engine didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t start just after a week after I got the new 2018 Mini Cooper. Had to call the tow truck and took it to the dealership. They told its the starter kit problem and had to replace the whole starter kit. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s terrible!
Brakes are noisy
I just find the keyless remote entry a little tricky to understand, I probably should go back to the dealer to get more instruction.  I can enter my car fine using the keyless entry but I can find it hard to know how to operate it when I want to open all the doors at once.
Cup holders are way too close to the shifter and not large enough, makes it very difficult to get cups in and out of the holders
we wish this model had all weather floor mats available
: The moon roof is loud when open
Sometimes doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand command
Same noise in driver door as described earlier.
Driver's door, when being  closed, has a vibration inside.  The noise is never heard again until the next time the door is closed.  It is not loud, and does not happen everytime.
 : radio control, particularly with satilite
When I first purchased the vehicle, I adjusted the seat to move forward. Once I began to drive the seat made a click noise and shifted backwards a little . When I had a passenger riding in the car with me the passenger seat did the same thing. It was kind of scary because I'm afraid as I continue to manually adjust the seats, sooner or later it will loosen up over time, and I just pray to God that the seats does not shift while driving, stopping, etc...
Not Accurate

When I say to call someone from my contacts, it never recognizes who I want it to call. I would also note that my phone never recognizes what I want it to say either, so I can only point blame on myself.
Looks like some type of glue melted and dripped down the side. Doesn't wash off
I thought that's just how the bulbs are because I came from a BMW and their lights are Xenon
A plastic piece in the interior section of the door opening on the front passenger side keeps coming off.
: Satellite radio stopped working.
Auto wiper function does not work correctly.
It is the sun screen cover for the rear sun roof. I have not addressed it with the dealership yet.
Seems like it is mid-aligned. Sounds different than my last mini.
Can't use the heads up display with polarized sunglasses - what an AWFUL design.
cup holder is too low and can't be used easily coffee spills
The car had a check emissions light @ about 1000 miles.  Took it in and it spent 4 days at the dealer to be told that it was a fuel mixture issues and that it had been fixed through software adjustment and oil change.  within 2000 miles, check emissions light was back on - this time needed new high pressure fuel pump.  So far hasn't come back
NOT BROKEN, IT'S THE WAY IT LOCKS AND MY 6 YEAR OLD HAS A HARD TIME SOMETIMES.

NOT VERY HARD TO OPEN PUT THE DESIGN IS WEIRD, HAVE TO PULL A FEW TIMES TO OPEN HOOD/RELEASE
SEEM TO HAVE MORE SPACE ON ONE SIDE THAN THE OTHER.
NOT SURE BUT THEY MAKE A LITTL NOISE WHEN MOVING SLOW, NOT SURE IF IT MAKES THE NOISE WHEN GOING FASTER OR NOT.  HERE IT WHEN I FIRST START TO DRIVE.
HAVING A HARD TIME PAIRING PHONE AND STORING RADIO STATIONS.
DRIVER SEAT IS HARD TO MOVE BACK AND FOWARD, SEEMS HARD TO MOVE WHEN NEEDED, NOT SURE IF IT'S NEW OR AN ISSUE.BACK SEAT HAS A BOOSTER SEAT, THINK LOCKS COULD BE A LITTLE HIGHER OUT OF SEATS TO REACH.
THINK SEAT LOCKS ARE TOO LOW TO REACH INTO SEAT.  CAN BE A LITTLE LONGER.
SCUFFS SEEM TO SHOW UP AND HARD TO REMOVE ON THE DASH PANEL AND DOOR PANELS.  DON'T THINK ITS AN ISSUE JUST TYEP OF MATERIAL USED.
a bit of a squeal early in day backing out of driveway ... once used a couple of times it subsides
ebrake is right next to the seat belt buckle on driver side.  Sometimes seat buckle does not allow ebrake to disengage properly
: Windshield washer nozzles aimed too low on windshield when driving over 30 MPH
'Mini' emblem broke loose. Was attached via rivet. Now there is a hole in the mat.
Rattle seams to be in in roof area. It occurs at various speeds but even very slow and relatively smooth road conditions, even in parking garages for example. Almost seems to be more a harmonic response  than actual bumpy road rattle.
Took delivery in rain.  Noticed small chips near fuel filler door within a day.  Dealer took care of 'touch up' service no charge
Chip in windshield.  Took delivery in rain.  Noticed the chip within one day.  Dealer replaced windshield.

voice system seems useless

I had 2 issues - a 'fuel door' failure and another computer-setting related gasoline mix problem
The trunk door is always locked.  It takes multiple 'unlocks' from my key fab or pressing the unlock button on the inside of the car to get it to unlock.
The wipers are difficult to control.  They don't have good timing.
When you use your key fab to lock the car, there is no sound.  I was able to program my Mini to make the lights flash, but it only does it once.  It would be nice if it made a sound to let you know that it was locked.  This is not an option.
It is was not explained to us that there is a sensor on the seat.  If there is nothing on the seat, then the light comes on to tell us.  The first time it did this, I called my dealership and they explained it to me over the phone.

The control panel on the Mini is all done with the car's mouse.  It is not as user friendly as it suggests.  When I read the manual, I have felt more confused and I have more questions.  When I have called my dealership to ask questions, I feel like they are making fun of me, because I can't figure it out.
: The back-up camera had 'glitches.'  It would not project an image.  It was black.
The Mini vets are all circular, including the knobs.  However, it is hard to tell if the vents are open and closed and which way the air is blowing.
The location of the front cup holders makes it difficult for the driver to access.  The driver's cup needs to be in the passenger's cup, so it can be accessed.  The passenger is not able to use the cup holder.  There is only one cup holder in the back of the car.
In the night, there is only one light in the trunk and therefore makes it hard to see all my items in the trunk. Lights would be best on top in the middle, and one on each side. Currently only on right side
There are too many steps in park assist, parallel parking on a busy street can be hard because of traffic and park assist comes in handy. But all the steps to use it, one runs the risk of missing their opportunity and then are out of luck and can't redo. Would have to self park. So discourages me from using it.
I'll be in the city or near suburbs and randomly the sat√É¬©lite radio will go in and out
I'll say a command and it completely reads back something opposite. I've tried several times and it doesn't work
The phone doesn't pair when I get in my vehicle. If it does only certain apps work. Or all apps would appear but they say that the phone is disconnected.
the navigation for the Mini countryman no longer has the feature of showing the roads as green or red for traffic. only the highways. when putting in a destination, it sends me to the most congested routes and reflects an unrealistic time that I will be arriving.
If I just use Siri she understands but the car voice button doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t always understand
Floor under dash, door sills and the glove box exterior get dirty and scuffed easily I clean regularly
The front cup holders are in a position that partially blocks access to some controls on the front panel.  The control panel is fairly low and tall beverage containers block the bottom two rows of the panel.
: 2 months after delivery. today i woke up with the preassure of my tires super low to the point i had to take it asap to fill. is this normal?
It would be nice if the doors unlocked when I press the button on the rear liftgate to open the trunk. I often open the trunk that way because I don't have to scramble for the remote when my hands are full. But my kids always want to get into the car while I'm loading the back & complain that it isn't unlocked yet. Not a big problem but would be nice :)
Audible indicators are so sensitive - they go off well before there is a risk of hitting something, so it actually makes it harder to judge when I should guide myself by them.
My Countryman is the first generation to have Apple CarPlay integrated , and the way it interacts with the other systems is problematic. I cannot use the voice recognition controls on the steering  wheel to make a call, for example, I can only do that via Apple CarPlay & it is pretty awkward do so - have to navigate into the Apple CarPlay interface and then use the touch screen...whereas the whole point of voice commands is to avoid doing that. It is much more difficult to make a call, play texts/voice mails, etc. safely  in this car than in some of my previous vehicles. Also if the Apple CarPlay mode is activated while you drive , Apple CarPlay then overrides whatever menu I was in previously and I have  to exit out of it and manually go back into the media screen or navigation 
When I have a tall bottle or tumbler, my knuckles bump against the cup/bottle when I engage put the gear shift in park. If you're not careful it can be painful.  If it is a tall bottle, it also blocks some of the instrument panel. Insulated mugs or bottles often don't fit in the cup holders - the bottles are too wide & too tall.
The flexible screen that covers the rear sunroof rattles over bumps if the screen is closed all the way to its stop position. When I back off the screen by 1/8 inch, it doesn't rattle, so there hasn't been an urgency to have the dealer look at it.
Overall electronic control unit failure
You hear the air coming into the car
Behind the cup holders. Would be more convenient if located in a more easy to reach hard to block area.
Reception to satellite radio is intermittent.  it is not terrible but I experience it several times on my drive to/from work.  This happens when I am driving on the freeway or side streets.  It doesn't matter if it is in cloudy or sunny weather.
the voice recognition system has been a bit frustrating.  I have tried to use it a couple of times and it has failed so I haven't tried to use it much anymore.
I tried out the driver heated seat soon after I received the vehicle.  I was a bit disappointed the seat really only got moderately warm.  I thought this was just how Mini set their seats.  Then I rode in the passenger seat and used the heated seat option and the seat was very warm - just how I like it.  This is when I realized there must be something wrong with the driver seat. : The driver side heated seat did not heat properly.
Have to lift up the top storage bin to be able to acess the lower open storage area.
cramped location, shift lever in the way,
Lower center of windshield has a ripple like distortion. Not really noticeable until you are about eye level with the dashboard.
scuff marks from shoes entering and exiting vehicle.
It's not that bad, it just seems like a window or door is not closed good and I hear wind noise.
When I'm on a phone call, the speakers  make a noise like the volume is too loud when it is not.  I turn the volume down and it does go away but then I can hardly hear the person speaking.

I've only tried it a couple times and it was difficult for the navigation to understand when I spoke the address.
Mini offers a 'second date' to go over car features.  I have not done that, so it's probably something they would address.  However, the radio is the most annoying thing about the mini.  The presets make no sense.  There's buttons that do nothing.  When I use my blutooth to listen to music and try to go back to the main radio, it goes to a different menu and off the preset menu that I want it to be on.  When you're driving, it's very annoying to go back to the preset menu.
The buttons that control this feature are dumb as well.  The light means it's not on, which is contrary to what you'd think.  I accidentally had this feature going, when the radio is on you can't really tell the engine has shut off.  So this was doing the off/on for a little while when I didn't really need it to.  Subsequently, the check engine light came on that indicated an emissions problem. If it was real, this is a big problem with the engine.  I realized this off/on thing had been on, so I turned it off.  The check engine light went away.  I think the constant off/on caused a problem.
emission light came on, I believe related to having the off/on automatic engine function turned on.  once I turned it off, light turned off.
On occasion the phone won't pair to the car quickly and I don't know why.
: The turning indicator is entirely TOO LOUD and annoying. The dealer said this cannot be adjusted.
The heated seats are the only reason I feel sufficient warmth in short drives, as the main heating unit takes a very long time to reach the desired temperature.
With white seats notice discoloration from wearing dark denim jeans. Have to regularly clean as it gets a blue tint. Am starting to look at options for a seat liner to help with this problem to not perminantly stain the leather. Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see mini offered any options, wish they did.
It takes the MINI about 5 minutes to connect to my iPhone, in fact, if I try to connect the bluetooth manually by selecting my phone on the screen, it takes even longer to connect.
You have to close the door very firmly for it to close but it's easy to slam it too hard.
Not often but sometimes bluetooth won't pick up.  Or, I often use Waze and listen to audio books at same time and I have to put on Waze screen to listen to book... otherwise the book won't pick up with bluetooth.
I use large water bottle which are sometimes difficult to fit in the holder.  They also block the space behind, where I leave my garage door opener, making that hard to access.
I was driving in a street of 35mph speed limit and I could not hear the person on my cell phone,  I had to pull over and park on the street.

The sensors are extremely sensitive and when is snowing the cameras set off thinking is an object and it continues to beep until I get out of my car and clean the sensors with a rag.


Again, it takes a lot of time for seats to achieve complete warmth.
I work in Michigan early in the mornings, it takes about 20 plus minutes for my car to achieve a warm temperature inside, where my spouse  vehicle is a BMW M2  and warms up within 5 to 10 min completely.
Cup holder is right below the buttons of the vehicle, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hard to insert or remove any beverage from it.
During an ice storm the collision sensors were coated with ice and the system did not work properly, thinking there was an object near the car.  After cleaning the ice off the sensors, it worked perfectly.
just a bit of wind noise, not as quiet as I would expect
Multiple steps required to find certain functions, not intuitive
The higher the fan speed, the louder it is.
When I accidentally brush my shoe against lower door panel/sill while getting out of the car, it leaves a mark that I can't clean off.
CarPlay rarely understands response to text message making it basically useless. MINI Navigation doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand simple commands like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìnavigate to Valley Fair Mall in San Jose California. √¢‚Ç¨≈ì instead I have to put in the full address of the mall this is ridiculous. It should be able to guide to land,arks without the full address. Also  It so often doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand my voice address requests that I end up just using Waze.

There is inductive charging in center console which is cool√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d rather have storage there.

The Apple Car Play integration works on one phone only.



I haven't had the opportunity to try it more than once, but it didn't recognize my voice or commands when i tried.  I'm waiting to try it again.
very hard to figure out how to maneuver between audio for waze, google maps - and music.  When connect it automatically plays apple music or audiobook that I was last on ... and then have to shut that off.  Also - I was told can't listen to radio and use bluetooth - yet, somehow one day it worked that I could have both - and haven't figured it out again... need much more detailed instructions on how to navigate between phone and mini audio system
same as previous response
I would prefer that they were power operated vs manual - not an option on the mini
very hard to move the seat and adjust it - again prefer automatic vs manual
kind of annoying - just need to get use to it

One iPhone paired immediately and has no problems.Our second driver iPhone will not pair.

Stuck valve
Black faux-leather material scuffs to gray easily
Looks like a ring scraped the paint above the driver side door on the trim above the window.
Tight space to get the seat belt plugged in
Right front wheel only, not left. Car does NOT pull.
CarPlay is awful, interrupts navigation for any nonsense text, doesn't resume music when text dismissed, head unit periodically reboots itself as if starting from new.
: The √¢‚Ç¨Àúkick under the bumper to open the tailgate√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ function hardly/rarely works
Could use a tutorial system
The run flat tires are terrible; noisy, harsh, terrible ride.  Changed to regular tires after 600 miles.
The collision avoidance sensors randomly sound a warning at the same time it turns on the park assist feature.  In order to stop the collision warning sound have to turn off the park assist feature that turned itself on.
sensors are either to sensitive or there is an issue with the whole system.
: re-circulate function of hvac system does not stay on.
: While listening to the radio, it automatically switches to a different media .  This has happened 8 - 10 times and usually in the same driving location.
The navigation system took me to the completely wrong place, a few miles away from the correct destination.  I have discontinued use of the system, so don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if this would have been a regular occurrence.
hard to locate
: when using the phone via bluetooth the speaker has lots of static and crackling sounds : phone calls via bluetooth speaker has static and crackling sound
passengers all have trouble w buckle when putting on the belt
rear view mirror difficult to move


Does not answer call immediately.  Have to wait 5+ secs before caller can hear me.  Have consistant popping noise during calls.  Load and distracting

Pop up display  rattles
: Using my iPhone together with the speaker system built into the vehicle has yielded less than optimal results.
: Seems hard to put fuel into car. Gas pumps seem to shut off after a little bit of pumping fuel into tank. Have to keep trying to move nozzle around to keep it flowing as not to shut off. So far this has happened every time I fuel up. Never ever had this issue with anything I owned. Someone told me it's the rate of how fast the gas comes out of the pump into the tank or something. Not sure. Somewhat annoying, but maybe I'll find the right knack to fueling up and not having to restart a bunch of times.
Mini has consistently made audio systems that are not intuitive at all.  American car makers have audio systems that are easy to understand and require no instructions.  Mini should offer a 400 level college course on how to use their system.
The automatic windshield wiper setting is difficult to understand.  It does not match the instructions provided on the Mini cooper website for this vehicle.  It does not match the instructions in the owners manual.
: I have the upgraded Harmon Kardon audio system.  However, the sound quality is poor.  I think this is because the system has limited equalizer capabilities. It only has adjustments for Treble and Bass.  There is no way to adjust mid-range audio performance.  I did take this to the dealer.  They were very friendly, but they indicated that it is simply a limitation in the Harmon Kardon system.  My hunch is that a software upgrade of the system is needed. If you could have someone from Mini contact me about how to fix this problem it would be much appreciated.  -Thanks.
Typically you can request that the voice recognition system will play a song, and the voice recognition system will agree to play a song, however, the song does not actually play.  The only thing worse than a voice recognition system that does not recognize your voice is one that does recognize your voice, agrees to perform the command then does not actually do it.  Better to not even have a voice recognition system, then one that suggests it will follow your commands and then actually does not.

: Radio unit malfunction



It will sometimes close completely after I'm done fueling. Sometimes it won't close until after I drive away to my next destination.
It will sometimes completely misinterpret what I'm trying to say. It sometimes even gets the wrong country.
They squeak a little, you won't notice if the windows are up and  radio is on.
they have a lot of fading

Mini embalem deteriated.
when you first pull down on the trunk you feel resistance and then it releases and closes quickly.  it shuts really loudly and sometimes it doesn't shut completely.  You really have to slam it for it to completely shut.
If you have a drink in the drink holder then it's difficult to reach the port.

I miss having cup holders in the back.  Front one is too small for my big bottle
Because I'm short, I'm not able to use the side visor. It hits the headrest because the seat is up so far.
One of the two power outlets in the front console did not function due to a standard usb connector not being long/deep enough to reach/make connection.  A Mini brand connector does work in the outlet.  The second usb outlet functions with a standard connector.
Back seat only has cup holders available on doors - bad place for cup holders, even with lids, drinks spill when doors are opened or closed. Doors really only hold bottles.  'Tall' size coffee cups do not fit in door panel holders - they do not sit in bottom of holder - lid rim catches on top of holders and dangle, creating risk for lid to pop off.  Today, vehicles must have regular cup holders in front and back seats.  Not on door panels.  Cup holders should be in consoles in floor center or seat center.
Driver's side window sun visor - unable to pull down when driver's seat is in the position that I have it in to drive.  So, I cannot use it.
stains easily and is not easy to clean
the noise is excessive at higher speeds to the point I have to turn the radio up
not sure if this is a problem or normal
Drivers seat does not get warm enough at all. Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stay warm. While passenger seat heats up just fine and remains very hot
It seems like the location of the seat belt buckle is too far back
We have yet to figure out how to use the voice commands on the navigation system.  It's just easier to manually input
Also - it is uncomfortable to reach in because of the angle of the opening. The glove compartment has nothing wrong with it - just poorly designed.
Under normal city driving conditions at times there is hesitation in shifting with no particular pattern or conditions.
The gaps on both front doors are off.
Only car where it wont automatically pair with my phone. And the steps to pair it is complicated.

: Glass roof rattles when open.


The AC will not blow in the face. The recirculate will not work on auto
I cannot get the AC to cool in the face.
The phone clip for vehicle navigation rattles on dashboard
Road noise tires could be the prooblem
I believe it is road noise car is low to the roadway a larger tire could help
: Seatbelt fastner needs to be taller, hard to find
Visor needs to be longer doesnt always block sun.   Too fat to put clips on
Locks will not lock doorYou must use key to lock doors when you turn off car to leave
: Center console must be reset each time you backup or get in and start car

Trying to fiqure out outside air flow thru vents very difficult When air conditioning is not onJust outside air
Perhaps categorizing this as excessive is incorrect. I do not consider this a defect so much as a known, if less than ideal, factor in purchasing this car. It does many things very well. Unfortunately acoustic attenuation is not one of them. I assume that it is attributable to the nearly all-glass roof that undermines the quietness of the cabin. But it is consistently observable that at elevated speeds, the wind and air movement increase the decibel level inside the car.
I neglected to test the front glass washer before departing the dealership. A few weeks later, on my first occasion to clean the glass, the fluid simply trickled out of the washer heads and did not reach the glass. I re-attempted washing several times  before resolving that it was a malfunction and calling to bring the car in. The problem was described as an issue of adjustment, which was corrected in a matter of minutes to ensure that the washer fluid sprays onto the glass now, and it remains functioning correctly.

: the preset buttons don't always stay stored
The navigation system is not intuitive and user-friendly. It is difficult to know how to enter an address by voice command or manually that will give the directions you need.
Passenger vanity mirror does not work. : The passenger side visor mirror was non-functional. The mirror light would not come on.
When open, the angle is such that things easily fall out.
I don't like the dial down by the break.  It is hard to find without looking and the whole process is just awkward

The whole system is very complex.  I have driven many 'smart' vehicles, and the processes in this car are way more complex than today's technology should have.  I spent about 6 hours trying to get all of the bits and pieces learned through the manual and they are confusing, difficult to implement and hard to use.  I read the entire manual, watched youtube videos and still confused.  Not happy about this car.
The latch feels broken when you pull it to push the seat forward.  The seat is very difficult to move and I was told I would need to bring it back to have it fixed, but the dealership is 6 hours away.  Not driving it.
It was delivered to me by a driver, and the car still smells like excessive air freshener.  I have driven it twice since it was delivered in December, and I am not excited about driving it again.  Parked at the moment. The dealership is 6 hours away and I feel stuck with this car.  Traded my 3 year old mini that still smelled new, and now I have one that smells awful and I don't want to drive it. We do not have a dealership close to home.
I gave up using the voice prompts after too many misinterpretations.
On the way home from buying the car I noticed that the bluetooth connection is VERY poor.  The speaker makes a VERY loud, frequent, and irritating snap, crackle and thud noise during conversation.  My phone is the Galaxy S8, which is a compatible phone.  I brought the car to the dealer.  They kept it for two days and said it was not a problem with the car, and that it is a known problem with connectivity between Mini and that they can do nothing to help me.
The navigation does give good voice prompts but if you did not hear it or pay attention there is no display to indicate your next turn/exit, etc. Only the destination, ETA is visually displayed. : Navigation program poor. There is not enough detail on screen for turn by turn guidance.  Available by voice only and no way to look in advance for next step.
I don't like to use the feature because when it restarts it often does it with a jolt.  I sometimes feel almost as if someone tapped my rear bumper!
My cups tend to be taller. It's awkward getting the cup in and out. It almost always hits the lowest controls on the instrument panel. It's about placement. The cup holder should sit out a little further.
This is a personal issue, something I don't prefer. It's hard to hear the click to know it's officially closed. Then when you try to keep turning the knob it doesn't move and it winds up hurting my fingers. It's fairly easy to open tho.
My XM  loses reception a lot. I can understand losing reception in a tunnel or on/under a bridge but in a city with clear skies, I shouldn't be losing reception so frequently. I've contacted XM and they sent me a link to refresh my signal and that didn't help at all.


The highest setting is just warm...and it cools quickly
Problem when both his & her keys in the car - radio stations sets disappeared
I am very aware of wind noises when I am driving the vehicle.
The recliner adjustment was initially hard to locate. Sometimes it doesn't seem to do anything when I pull it. The seatback's most upright position is not upright enough for my preference and not as upright as my 2010 MINI.




Car is a convertible, and the windows close into slots in the convertible top . Slots are probably not sufficiently soft of or padded enough to absorb the vibrations. Will take car back to the dealer soon to see if they can alleviate the issue.
the driver seat heats up slower than the passenger seat and does not get as hot - the dealer showed me the heat sensor and the issue may be due to the vented materials on the seat.
If you use the handle you are opening the trunk. If you don't shut it with the right force it stays open. Just awkward
Truly the issue is that if you leave the headrests in you have zero visibility in the back. If you remove them you have a ton of vision.
It's only on the passenger side there is a rattle it appears to be coming from the door area.
They are a strange size and so most of my bottles rattle around in them or they don't fit. I have yet to find the 'perfect' fit cup
It's too small but probably has to be because the car is so small :)
Sometimes it is difficult to buckle up with the seat belt due to the placement of the buckle and the relative location of the center compartment
Whenever I unlock my car, I have to press it around ten times for the back doors to unlock and open.
The console is very small and cannot fit much of anything inside.
It doesn't understand anything I say. For example, if I say Ferndale for the city, it tells me Melody Dale doesn't have a phone number.
sometimes the camera does not turn on the screen when putting the car in reverse, happens infrequently
one time driving lost connection to radio, could not get any stations, seemed to be a connectivity issue with HD or the radio itself? the radio was back to normal after getting in the car later in the day
seems to have poor recognition of voice, commonly misunderstands

x
Audio connection with mobile phone is inconsistent .
The headlights just don't light up the road as well as those on my 2017 Prius or 2016 Corvette.  My MINI has the standard headlights.  I've read the the optional ones are better.
: The 'automatic delay' setting for the wipers doesn't do what I'd like.  It runs the wipers too much.  I'd rather have a basic delay setter, with variable delay.
I have spoken with the dealership about this. They say the battery in the key fob is low. It is a simple replacement. I just haven't gotten around to doing it yet.
After awhile the heater stops heating  and then it blows cool air. I have to keep turning up the heat to maintain the interior temperature.
: Radio is difficult to navigate. Referred to the owners manual unable to locate assistance.
seat belt buckle/release is positioned low between driver's seat and center console causing it difficult to engage.
Seat stitching unravelling on passenger seat between seat thigh support extender and seat bottom.
Loose mounting bolt repaired by dealer
rough spot on chrome trim



It didn't seem to be attached well.
you have to speak very slowly or you'll end up in the wrong state for navigation. :)  For the most part it works well
If you text from your phone, Apple carplay stops pairing. It takes a long time for the prior soundsystem choice  to reconnect after reading a text in carplay
: The sunroof rattles
: The rear tailgate would open spontaneously, often while I was away from the vehicle, without any command from the vehicle remote or otherwise.
: 1. The vehicle's speedometer is set to register slightly faster than the car is actually travelling. Consequently, I do not know what the actual speed the car is moving at.2. The vehicle's digital trip odometer is weird. As the vehicle travels each 1 mile on the main odometer, every other mlle the trip odometer either registers .6 mile or 1.4 miles. So only at the end of 2 miles of travel is the trip odometer accurate. Weird.
To lower the rear seats when additional cargo room is required, there is no control accessible from the rear of the car. Lowering the seats requires someone to move around to the sides of the car, open the rear door and pull a strap located at the intersection of the seat bench and backrest. When trying to lower the entire rear , it is awkward to do this from one side... you have to do two sections from one side and then walk around to the opposite side of the car to complete the task.
normal use of the brake is accompanied by a squeaking sound
doesn't seem to work that well
hard to enter an address unless it is EXACTLY what is stored..... like SOUTH vs S  or DRIVE vs DR  ...... little stuff makes it awkward

: The drivers side door rubber seal is slightly ripping/wearing - I believe it is from brushing against it as I enter the car to sit. I can't avoid brushing against the rubber door seal, and I am not pleased to see that it is wearing.
The seats seem to take much longer to heat than my previous MINI
The interior visor covering the sunroof rattles in all positions. : moonroof interior visor rattles in all positions.
Does not always close, have to close more than once.
Wipers use of auto-timer does not work as described in manual and controls are not clear.  Design is so bad I do not use auto-mode.  Recommend using standard timed wiper.
Primary vehicle information display is poorly designed - menu to get to information is cumbersome.
Previously owned mini-cooper, which had controls on center console.  Brand should be consistent between models.
Could not enable auto-reposition for passenger rear-view mirror in user manual or in-vehicle manual.  Had to lookup online via BMW site.
Minor spot on driver door column.
The problem is noticeable with a quick acceleration from the stop. When I introduced an approximately a second pause between releasing the brake pedal and pushing the accelerator pedal, the rough shift became less noticeable.
It goes off so constantly that it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t add valuable information.


Scuffing happens during entry and exiting vehicle.
Piece of plastic molding came to go just below the passenger door
Break pedal makes squeeky noise.
: When trying to close the windows, when it reached to the top position, windows started rolling down automatically.  After shutting of the engine, it worked normal.
Cannnot reach ports if cup holders are used
There was no printed instruction provided. I wish they can give you a basic function cheat sheet.
the pull lever is covered by the seat belt.
storage space in the door is to narrow and shallow. I cannot even put my sunglasses or umbrellas.
They are too short to hold containers. There should be some support mechanism for smaller containers.
It does not shift down, then nocks when try to accerelate
Noisy after car sits following a rain or snow incident
Low tire indicator comes on too frequently and is not easy to clear




Apple CarPlay frequently disconnects to play applications notifications sounds and then does not return to previous media.
No lock on glove box.


Bluetooth is too sensitive. Dials numbers I don't want dialed.
: Programming the seat does not always take and/or difficult to understand why it doesn't work. It could be related to different driver profiles, but confusing either way. It is not a major problem or inconvenience and does not change my feelings for the vehicle.
Mini is small by nature, but it would be nice to have a few more options or more space to store a couple items. This is not a major problem or change my overall enjoyment with this vehicle.
The cup holders that are difficult are the door ones. They do not fit large cups and are hard to remove items when sitting in the seats.
I am assuming it is still in the wearing in phase and have not paid much mind to it  as I adjust.
First the pairing with android is lackluster at best.  The function is super limited and not well integrated with auto systems.  Then for the limited items I can use it for, it generally takes a few tries.
Does not work well with Android - barely works at allSuper limited capabilities -
The steering system has an alert that the steering wheel may by hard to turn, and to make an appointment to take it to the dealer right away
: When switching in between FM radio station channels there is a delay before the next radio station picks up/plays music.
Controls are difficult to locate/hard to reach.
The controls are difficult to locate and very stiff to operate.
: I do not like that the controls go up or down in 2 pt. increments vs. 1 pt. increments for heat/air. The controls also seem backwards as well. I always turn them the wrong way and have to correct myself when I want to lower or raise the temperature. Also, whenever I put the vent on and tell the car to recirculate the air from the car only , it eventually turns itself off, pulling in outside, highway air.
When the center console is placed in the upright position, it occasionally squeeks & rattles when accidentally hit or when driving on bumpy roads.
The cup holders are not adjustable.
The outside sensor only works occasionally and sometimes the hatch only goes down half way and it is hard to manually push it all the back to the locked position.
I'm getting used to it.  How the heck does it work?
I cannot find the intermittent function, it really needs one.  The Auto function has poor sensors.  It thinks a drizzle is a downpour, basically the wipers are going too fast for the rain condition.
Mostly its OK, but I have 3 phones paired on it and it always seems to be on the wrong phone
Too much fogging up of windows when people enter car.
Terrible mileage, maybe 18 on the highway and 14 around town.
Factory installed the wrong side badges/scuttles than what I ordered.
Scrolling through radio stations does not wrap around. Station preset buttons do not work as expected. Moving joystick forward/backward does not give intuitive menus, difficult to find what you want.
Previous MINI Cooper had headlight controls on the left steering column stalk.  Current MINI has them on the panel down and to the left of the steering column.  It's an unnatural reach to get to them, and you can't see them from normal driving position.  A minor disappointment.
I listen to music on an old MP3 player plugged in to the AUX port.  However, I use the phone for navigation.  The phone is successfully paired with the car, and I can place and receive calls through it, which override the AUX music as expected.  However, when the stereo is set to the AUX port, voice prompts from the phone navigation software aren't heard.  I have to switch the car's music source to the phone's Bluetooth connection to be able to hear the navigation prompts.
Driver side heater control would shut itself off after five seconds, then refuse to turn on again until after engine had been shut off.  Was repaired by dealer .
: The recirculation toggle  won't stay in recirculate mode, keeps setting itself back to fresh air.  Have not yet brought to dealer's attention.
Having driven for the past 20 years with a 5- or 6-speed manual, switching to automatic continues to be a learning experience for me.  The most common annoyance is when I want to accelerate, and the transmission needs to 'think about it' for a second before down-shifting.  This is almost certainly an issue common to automatics, and not an indictment of MINI in particular.I've tried their 'pseudo-manual' mode, but found it lacking as I have to look at the display to see what gear I'm in.  With a real manual transmission, you don't have to look; just put your hand down and feel where the stalk is.
The navigation system does not understand my words.


A vinegar smell comes from the AC when turning the car and sometimes while driving
The mini dealership said it was a bad combination of fuel and air.  They repaired it, updated the computer system,  and changed the oil. It came back on about a month after that and then went off by itself a day or two later










Fuel pump regulator was damaged due to a leak in the sunroof drain.
: Bluetooth connectivity to phone. Sometimes song on display does not match what actually is playing. Have to restart playlist to get it to work.
Strange loud noise when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear. Randomly happens. Not sure what the issue is so far.
The driver information display  wasn't working upon delivery. The computer was not appropriately updated when delivered. The dealership just needed to download and install a computer update to resolve the problem.

It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s down in front behind the gears stick and where my cup sits- very awkward to use, reach, adjust, locate
My phone doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t recognize what I am saying
The seat √¢‚Ç¨≈ìextensions√¢‚Ç¨¬ù are always popping out if I accidentally swipe them with any bags I am stowing on the front passenger floorboard.  So I am constantly havyto pop them back in and it is rather and.
All the radio/mediacontrols get in the way of the cup holder and console storage-seems dumb to have all these controls down where you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really look at them if you are driving. Not logical to have controls in console and does not allow for arm rest to come forward enough to use. Just bad design for use and for comfort.
I use a Yeti 24 oz tumbler but the area for my cup will not accommodate my Yeti or Any similar insulated cup 24 oz or larger.  I can fit my cup into the holder but there are too many other buttons and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s too close to the gearshift handle and the straw I use bumps the buttons and gearshift, too.  I cannot use my cup holders√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ carrrier handle because they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fit.  I was told by dealership that there are √¢‚Ç¨≈ìaftermarket √¢‚Ç¨≈ì solutions only.

USB PORT IS WEAK REQUIRES AN ADAPTER. NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH TO CHARGE A PHONE. AUX OUTLET HAS POOR CONNECTION.

It doesn't happen all the time, but it does happen often now. Not sure if it's due to my phone which is over 3 years old or if it's a problem with the car. Sometime my Apple Car Play is not there when I get in my car & it takes a bit for it to reconnect.
Have not used the Navigation too much. Took a road trip & it was complicated to use for the first time. Once I figured out how to enter an address, it was great & it worked well. Maybe it will get easier the more I use it.
The system has worked once. Every time since then it never understands and will place a call rather than playing a song or vice versa.
My phone frequently will not be recognized and will take a very long time to show up, if at all. Sometimes it will show up, we will be listening to something and switch to the maps or something and we can then if we try and go back to what we were listening to, it can no longer be heard as the pairing is gone. It is very odd. Calls also seem to take a very long time to connect.
Driver's door would NOT shut.  No matter what.  I tried everything.  So did the service technichan
The Driver's door did not close at all. Cold Weather.  Service moved the bar forward so that the latch would hook.
I cannot locate, wasted hours to understand , how to tell how much gas range or how many miles it can go in the amount of gas I have.

it doesn't heat up fast enough.   After I reach my destination, then it heats up
: Missing a button on a rear headrest that allows you to move the headrest up and down.  I am going to contact the dealer to have it installed.  I only noticed it months after buying the car when I was putting the seats down flat.  There is a raw hole in the seat covering where the button unit should be.


I have not been able to get the headrest to fold down in spite of using the controls.
I have the wireless phone charger feature which I like, but it takes up the entire concealed space in the center console.  The area below is open to the vehicle and not concealed, so I don't want to put anything there.
: Sometimes when I push the button to turn on the engine, the lights come on but it does not start.  Then when I put it in reverse it doesn't go.  I have to turn everything off and try again.  I think it is because I am putting it in reverse too quickly while it is booting up.
: Turn signal is super loud while talking on the phone over bluetooth.
Grey color seems to retain blue jeans color in driver seat. In passenger front seat, shows dirt easily.
Does not recognize addresses when spoken slowly.
Reroutes driver on long trips - over100 miles without prompts. Directs me to exit every exit on route.
Sun visor on drivers side window does not fold down when drivers seat is forward.
You first unlock the car to unplug the charger. At random times, the car will automatically lock again within a few seconds after removing charger and you have to play a game of trying to unlock again and reach the handle before it locks again.
The auto tailgate is behaves randomly. Sometimes you can get it to respond to your foot motion and other times it just acts like you are not there. Also at times, you press the tailgate button to open on your key fob and it won't open all the way. Standing good distance and in open space so nothing for tailgate to hit.
Within the first few weeks the braking pad areas which are highly visible from the outside are rusted. Discussed with dealer and told 'that is what they do'.
Side door easily scratched by other cars opening doors next to vehicle in the parking lot. Also, I have the black hub/wheels. I was not told how easily they scratch if you get next to a curb. One slight rub and your black wheel/rims have silver scratches showing through. Would have expected higher quality rims that could withstand standard parking situations.
It can't get basic reception of some of the main channels in the Seattle area. It almost seems like they are making it bad so you opt in for satellite radio. No thank you.
Apple CarPlay and the car do not get along a majority of the time. Somedays it will work the first few times in/out of the car. Other times it won't find the phone and is stuck in the spinner of death mode and will not connect. Have to shut phone down and restart. Turn car off and restart. Really bad experience.
There is a rattle, no idea how to get it to stop. Will follow up with dealership and next visit.
It 'stumbles' sometimes when if switches from electric mode to gas
The passenger side shoulder belt area
The brake stopping is not compatible with the rest of the handling of the car
Too confusing due to all the information in the center console
FM presets are difficult to understand
: Rattle in the sunroof when open
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like that all doors don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t open when walk up and press buttons

When accelerating it sounds like something is loose in engine
There are long periods of signal loss even in open areas.  We are not experiencing this with our other car
When ever the car is in motion there is a rattle from the left rear area.  It could be the door or maybe the rear seat.
When stopping notices this action
Have to really look to see in drive,consistently look to sii if in park before i trust removing foot from break.
Randomly occurs

Cheaper materials used for seats,dust collectors, scuff marks very visible, hard to keep clean : It accumulates dust quickly, the seats attract dust and is hard to stay clean
Compared to the 2015 i had, not much consoles spaces  pockets missing in back seats
Really disappointed with the material -plastic? Used for the panel and dashboard, collects dust easily, and looks old and scuffed up,after day 1 : It accumulates dust quickly, the seats attract dust and is hard to stay clean
The trunk lid must be closed forcefully, if not, the lid is not locked in place.
Some of the pictures in the manual don't match up with my model vehicle.
There are so many options stacked on one another which change at the push of the same button.

: Appears to have a leak on the drivers side window
Usually whatever contact name is being said needs to be repeated
The displayed information √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsinks√¢‚Ç¨¬ù over time. I set it to the highest setting, but after a couple of weeks I have to reset it again.
All presets for radio and satellite radio are on same menu. Took me a while to figure this out- expected them to be separate. Also doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t return to satellite station after a phone call or using another function. I typically just stream music from my phone because it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s easier. Apple car play is well done.
The rear license plate holder is not secured at the bottom--so it rattles loudly  when you close the trunk.  Bad design that a couple more mounting screws would fix.  Notice this same cheapy experience on wife's BMW as well--in the genes?
Seems like a awful lot of tire-road noise; and it's crude noise--not at all like my Porsche 911
Handbrake location is just in the way of the transmission shifter.  Poor design.
There is a vague sense that the car 'wanders' side-to-side on the highway.  When the car was delivered I was shocked to observe that the tires for 5-6 pounds low and at different pressures at each wheel.  That might have contributed to the wandering.  After equalizing the pressures up to spec. it seems a little better.  The high performance tires on my Porsche 911 have a tendency to follow highway grooving--the MINI's behavior is different--almost as if there's an alignment or other suspension issue.
The car is just noisy--lots of crude road noise.
Ditch the 'cuteness'--install real clearly functional analog gauges in a logical array instead of mixing different types of displays and arranging them is such an illogical manner.
The thermostat settings are too course  so it's either cooling or not cooling in the 74-78 degree range.
There's a very annoying rattle that I think is coming from the glove box latch--
I like that it can be adjusted as to placement --just not a very useful space for something that takes up all that room.
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an automatic lift gate that can be operated by your foot or button. The foot operation is very temperamental and works maybe 25% of the time so we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really even try
The trunk tailgate hard to open with foot and close with foot !
Hard to used

It doesn't recognize a point of interest, eg. Safeway. It wants me to enter an address, in which I obviously don't know, because I am asking it how to get there.
front right tire keeps losing pressure.  I have needed to have it refilled twice.
Everyone who has been a passenger has had difficulty with the seat buckle. I think they are attached too far back on the seat.  You have to align the buckle EXACTLY and keep it very straight.  My 2004 Cooper was just 'click and go'....no fuss.  Also, I find that I have to have the arm rest up, otherwise it gets in the way.
It may just be that this car is an 'S' and my previous one was not.  I feel like I am at the gas station all the time.  I would probably not buy an 'S' again.
When I am parking the car, the gear shift sticks just before it goes into Park.  So, it is a 2 step Park.


door panel scuff with normal use. Dashboard shows fingerprints too easily.

slight noise, like something is loose
sounded loose, dealer fixed
check engine light came on.  happened during winter, when temps were below 40 degrees.
Noticed a bubble one day. Havent taken it in yet, making an appointment soon.
I constantly have issues pairing my device or using the blue-tooth system. In my other mini I did not have issues hearing media when paired, in this Mini I do, I have to disconnect in order to hear my media on the phone, or I need to connect an auxillary chord and go through a difficult and annoying process which causes an issue when trying to repair it and I'm in motion. Most times it will not pair back again for some time. I have not had the time to take the vehicle in yet to be addressed.
Waving your foot underneath is supposed to open the Hatch but it rarely works.
Service said it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s from the luggage rack on top of the car
The center dial in between the front two seats is in an awkward location. Plus, learning to control the dial has proven difficult 
In the immediate moment when I need to sound the horn, it is not easy to locate the place to press it. I've gotten used to it, but this was not obvious.
Lots of rattling from the retractable roof 

When I hit the fob it dosent allways unlock. When car is unlocked seems like it's stuckso I relook and unlock from fob. Not sure if I'm just to quick to try opening or if it's not releasing and stuck.
Can feel every bump. Not very shock absorbent




So tiny.can barely fit my sunglasses.
I am very short and the visor located on the drivers side won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t come down due to the seat being pulled up so I can reach the pedals. I have to recline my seat every time I want to use it.


Upon entering the vehicle the onboard stereo / phone management features routinely fail to connect automatically, frequently requiring manual intervention.
Front cup holders are too small and located to close to the lower dash - placing a beverage here prevents access to lower dash controls and traps the container between the lower dash and the gear selector lever. Depending on th size of the cup it may need to be removed before the vehicle can be placed in Park.
: The issue is not with the car, but with the location signal for the radio.
The gasket/seal split at the front of the driver's side corner of the sun roof.  Mini of Madison WI diagnosed that corrected the problem, which they had not previously seen and there have been no problems since.
The tires on any surface other than very smooth make a lot of road noise
In dash storage compartment has been eliminated.
SOMETIMES IT DOESNT UNDERSTAND ME
: Rubber door seal on rear passenger door is not properly positioned so the door does not close properly.
Circumference slightly too small for most containers. This might loosen up with time and use.
The mats do not cover the floor area sufficiently.
when I get a call and I press the phone button on my steering wheel, it doesn't always go on bluetooth and sometimes stays on my iphone...it may be my phone
Appears to be scratches on both headlight lenses

: Head restraint to far forward AND THERE IS NO adjustment. It occurs everytime I sit in the seat.
Mostly at a stop when engine shuts down. it stumbles when accelerating from that spot.
: Stowable picnic seat in rear was not fully stowed and got caught in the locking latch for the lift gate causing the lift gate to be stuck and tearing holes in the seat.
Open clicking fob button latch doesn't always release
Not a major problem. Made some noise , usually when turning. Took it in for service, repaired promptly. Now it's fine!
It was working fine. Something got messed up within the last month. I will re-connect my phone numbers and see if I did something wrong. If still not working, I will take to dealer.Whenever I speak commands for navigation, it doesn't recognize my voice commands. Always comes back with the wrong addresses.

Satellite radio connection constantly drops signal. I have reset the receiver and the issue still persists.
I've only used my navigation once because it was wrong. I had my phone's nav and the MINI's nav going simultaneously and I kind of knew the general area and knew which exit I should get off on, which is the one my phone told me to get off on as well, and my MINI nav told me to keep going. I'd be willing to give it another try, just as long as I had my phone's nav going as well.
The dashboard and door panel material is a porous rubbery material that shows marks easily and doesn't wipe clean like typical dashboard materials.
: I don't know exactly the name of the piece but the at the front passenger door, a plastic frame fell off about a week after I purchased the car.  I fixed it back to place by myself.
: sales person and our family cannot get the hands-free power trunk to work.
memory is tied to key, yet it appears not to be.  I'm sure it is operator error.  it is difficult to see the buttons which compounds the issue

does not understand commands
console is in the way
Being  use to my first countryman I had the middle speedometer that was huge and I could always look over and see my speed was correct, my new countryman is right in front of me and most times I lose the digital number of speed and then have to look to find my speed in front of me above the wheel. When looking away from traffic is difficult when Im on the thruway.
: Seat belts, my husband complains all the time, actually overtime we get in the car.  The seat belt does not have a latch on it to keep it close to the top of the belt, so were always fishing to find the belt to pull it forward then buckle it in.
if anyone is eating in care and drops scaps of food on seat once washing it it seems to leave marks of stain on seats
trying to get a tim hortons coffee cup out of cup holder in back is difficult the cap on cup wants to pop off because its hard to get ahold of the cup with hands and pull up, have to be extremely careful not to spill.
mostly seats become slightly oil looking if someone has to wait to get material to clean up a spill until they get home. once clean it looks like the spots are still there.
It's turned on but it rarely seems to actually tell me that something is in my way.
: Because it has the automatic engine shutdown, it does not accelerate quickly from a stop at intersections/stoplights etc.  This can be particularly annoying when I'm in stop and go traffic.  It's not a repair issue - it's a functional issue.
I speak as plain as possible and I have to do it several times before it works but most of the time I have to type it in
: On drivers door panel there is discoloration with the black panel. Looks like blushes spots



Storing preset radio stations doesn't seem to work or very unintuitive.
Hard to find the list of commands that can be used.
DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN SONGS ON AN IPHONE X. SOUND QUALITY IS REMARKABLY BETTER WHEN CONNECTED VS. USING THE BLUETOOTH. : OPERATING BETWEEN SONGS ON AN IPHONE X - THE EXPERIENCE IS QUITE CLUNKY AND OFTEN REQUIRES I USE MY PHONE TO CONTROL THE SONGS VS. THE CAR'S CONTROLS
: The kick-open feature of the hatch is very difficult to use  AND the wipers are average-at-best .
: The kick-open feature of the hatch is very difficult to use  AND the wipers are average-at-best .
: Certain features work sporadically 

Contacts are not syncing, causing me to dial from my phone...which isn't as safe. : Certain features work sporadically 

Too many menus to enter and select an address, poi or store a location. When using verbal commands it expects an address only and can't seem to do poi.
Cannot synchronize driver and passenger temperature. Can adjust fan speed manually when the system is set to auto but then you can't understand what the auto will control.

when we bought the car it had been sitting outside in the winter and the battery failed.  Mini replaced but there was a backorder so we had to drive a loaner for the first seven days.
Each time I try to put a coffee cup in the coffee spills.
Rain sensing wipers tend to go high speed in light rain. The speed adjustment appears to be meaningless, that being the driver has no control over the wipers. Very annoying.
When merging left onto a roadway, attempted to lean forward so I could look left out the window to see if there was oncoming traffic, the seatbelt locks preventing me from being able to see oncoming traffic. Car has a bad blind spot on the left, mirrors are insufficient and now blind spot warning system available.
The floor on the driver side makes a popping noise when I move my left foot.
: Rear hatch sometimes opens on its own
seems to get hung up on itself alot

The rear storage area.  There is no sound deadener material in the spare tire well.
The controls are between the seat and B pillar, making it difficult to reach. Dealer cannot fix an design issue.
Dealer replaced it.
Thinking this is just the nature of FM radio reception. But then, I typically don't listen to FM radio...only listened until I had Satellite installed.  I was a bit disappointed that the vehicle did NOT come already equipped with Satellite...Volkswagen  has this 'standard' in their vehicles.
The entire audio function is NOT user friendly.  Having a 'nerdy' spouse, even HE had a difficult time working through the radio/satellite/etc controls. Again, Volkswagen is MUCH more user friendly.
So, Mini has this separate 'kit' to mount cell phones on the dash.  Unfortunately, my Samsung Note 8 appears barely enough 'fit' to hold it, AND try to plug into it's nearby USB port.  It appears to be just a manufacturing snag on the 'kits' for larger phone...seems like it's meant for just the apple phone sizes :-(
Too narrow of clearance to buckle seatbelt into it's notch 
Sun roof panel screen cover...tends to have a bit of rattling when pulled back
Scuffed easily while vacuuming the seat.
My wife and I carry a fob. Car can be confused with which is in control.
Took a while to find. Very subtle
Had it fixed at dealer
I was told it could not be fixed because of my model iPhone 7 plus

I took the car in to be diagnosed. I was told there was a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbug√¢‚Ç¨¬ù with my iPhone 7 Plus.
Happens whenever an unavoidable pothole is hit. You can feel it shudder under your feet. You have to release slightly then press to come to a stop.
the car was pulling to the right the day I pulled off the lot.
The fan can get very loud. I find myself yelling over it if on the phone and my music to be played very loud when using it on high.
Have had difficulty with navigation recognizing addresses.  Not sure when it happens, perhaps when the vehicle is in motion.  All other voice recognition seems fine.
sometimes, the music from my phone just stops working, even if it says that it is connected to the car and that the song is on play, it'll stop.
The left upper dash speaker sounds loose or the speaker is intermittently cuts out.

I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t actually trade an effort to understand. They just aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t intuitive
Heat doesn't stay maintained long
seats soil easily and hard to clean off
There are 2 handles in the trunk that can be moved so that the you can expand the opening for the trunk on a convertible.  This will allow you not only open the trunk but lift up the back window so that there is a larger opening to the trunk.  I have had problems getting the 2 handles back in the correct positions.  If they are not exactly in the correct positions you are able to shut the truck door.  I have had to try several times on more than one occasion to get the trunk door to shut again.  I don't think there is anything wrong with my mini, I just think the feature is a little difficult to use properly but maybe I will get the hang of it over time.
I would like all doors to unlock with the keyless entry and the rear door remain locked despite following directions to have all unlock

When I press and hold the button to activate the voice recognition system, it 'dings' to listen, then immediately shuts off. It does this 99% of the time on the first try, then works on the second try.
My travel mug fits, but it's very snug. With an opening on my lid, I would be concerned about spilling.
It is my in ability to figure all this out and how to maneuver the system.   my lack  of knowledge. : Again it is not the car just my lack of knowledge.
I need to be better educated .  Bluetooth goes in and out , sometimes connects , sometimes does not .  Can not even figure out how to change time.  Things were shown to me at time of obtaining vehicle , but have not worked since.  I just have not had time to go back to the genius man at the dealership. : Again it is not the car just my lack of knowledge.
really ore of an configuration of space isssue . it is very awquard
using an insulated water bottle is difficult to get in/out of the location in front of the shifter, behind the start toggle
: Bluetooth module did not work properly. When making a phone call people could not hear me speaking but I could hear them. The dealer had to replace the HUH  one week after taking delivery of the vehicle. The original HUH was defective. The new HUH resolved the problem.

Trunk was slightly misaligned at delivery.  Was corrected the next day.
Took many tries to figure out what it wanted - even the dealer had an issue understanding what it was asking for.  Once you figure it out, it works great.  Dealer had a technician set up a parking space and talk me through the process.
To this day, I've never been able to find the engine temperature gauge. And for whatever reason, even though I've tried to set the display several times to show the odometer and trip odometer, it always defaults back to only showing the speed. I don't have a dealership in town to take it to so they can explain the issue, but I will take it to the dealership the next time I leave town.
The vent on the right side of the steering wheel is obstructed by the steering wheel itself, and also by my hand if my hands are at 10 and 2. It's not that big of a deal, really, but noticeable for sure.
The lower area of adjustment could be a little more curved / concave at lower back. It seems to push lower part of back too much and can't be adjusted for less push.
The center console is only for charging an iPhone 8 , no room for sunglasses, tissues...
It's because it's a convertible
Seems like it only comes out the left driver's side vent.  Doesn't come out the right driver's side vent unless on Max power
Can't turn off auto when in the car wash
Not sure if the indicator will let me know automatically if tire needs pressure
I don't use the moon roof as it is too bright when open
I hate the fact that they moved the speedometer away from the center of the console and I hate the size and nature of the new tachometer.
With armrest down, seat belt buckle is very difficult to access
Hard to disengage when trying to let a person out from the back.  Seems to get stuck
if I have too much weight in packages on passenger seat the seat belt keeps pinging


Rear tailgate has 'kick to open' feature which always opens the tailgate but does not always raise the tailgate.


: The body covering for the tow latch ended up missing after having maintenance done on the vehicle. Unknown if it occurred at the dealership or somewhere else. I asked my dealer if he could get me a new covering and I have not heard back from him. It has been over a week.
I've gotten a nail in my tire and also had a bubble in my front passenger tire. I have been told that due to the tires on the vehicle, they may be more apt to having bubbles or other issues.
Apple Car Play will disconnect sometimes for no reason. I figure it is more of a problem with the phone service than Mini.
: to the rear of the front driver door frame, there is a plastice piece about a foot long. It came loose. I mentioned it to the Mount Laurel Mini in New Jersey. 
software not loading 
Navigation system loading message which also affects satellite ratio
called MINI who said to wait 20 minutes and restart 
Does not always 'remember' which driver position to assume with key fob unlock, or the sequence of events required to initiate memory movement is not intuitive. : Memory of seat is intermittent.
Tires deflated rapidly and I had to refill.  Had similar problem with previous Mini - it seemed that when the weather changed , I would have to reinflate the tires.  Also, I had tire problems with my last Mini in that I had three tires pop at different times when I hit potholes.
I find it difficult to see where I am and where I'm going.  I've mostly just continued using navigation systems on my phone.
Door has minor rattling when driving
 : system has hard time understanding verbal commands when trying to call certain people in contacts

it just takes awhile for the air conditioning to cool the whole vehicle
Takes time for the heater to warm up and distribute the amount of heat throughout the vehicle.


This is simply a noisy car, especially, but not only, when the top is down.  I have driven other convertibles for years  and had less of this issue.
Although the brakes improved in the first two months or so of driving, they are simply not stellar brakes.

Rear seat headrest interfere with rear view for driver.


Was hard to locate knob to adjust seat.
Controls were hard to find.  Hard to get in perfect position.
The vent doesn't blow in right direction for air conditioner. Hard to figure out.
I don't use the auto parallel parking assist system - it is difficult to use.
I have had problems connecting my iphone via bluetooth.  I've had to delete it and add it in order for it to work.
When it is really cold and snowing the windshield does not properly clear the snow/ice.  Sometimes I have to get out of the vehicle and manually clear the windshield.  I had this problem on my last Mini also - 2012 Mini Countryman.
white seat has since turned blue from blue jeans

HAPPENS THAT CAR ROLL OUT FEW TIMES AFTER PARKED IN LOW INCLINATION ROAD
: There is some type of vaccum in the front when going through water sucked up water in engine car was to be. Total had car 3 months repaires cost over 17,000. To fix
I have difficulty entering city. It presents similar but incorrect cities.  Insufficient letters & numbers  to select from for cities & street address.  Voice control is iffy.
there is a plastic cap in the same color as the body of the vehicle that covers a cavity containing a threaded fitting which can hold a tow ring. That cap is knocked out by the brushes at the car wash. The fit is not tight enough!
My tires sensors constantly say my tires are low. I have to put air in my tires at least once a week sometimes more often.
The easy knob in the middle is terrible. Twisting it around trying to find what I need certainly makes for distracted driving more so than the controls I used to have on the dashboard.
My knee often strikes the switch, turning on lights, when exiting the vehicle.
We prefer a lever for a handbrake rather than the little switch/toggle that's in the car.  It's just not designed as we'd like.
I've returned the car twice to the dealership for this issue.  Calipers and pads were replaced twice.  I was told that there was rust on the discs, which seemed odd to me as the car was only weeks old and had less that 1500 miles on it.  Brakes still make noise but not as much ...



Standard headlights use H-4 bulbs..early 1970s tech.  I would have gotten optional LED headlights if I had known they where this bad.  I live in a very rural area 
I have big  feet
the child-proof door lock doesn't not seem to disengage
gap between center console and passenger seat can make buckling the seat belt difficult in certain seat locations, as hands do not easily fit.
black interior combined with texture collects dust from shoes rapidly.
I'm not sure if I answered correctly.  It would not operate from trying to pull the seat belt to buckle.  It was stuck and it took a bit to pull and pull and try to unstick it.  It eventually did without having to take it in.  It happened every so often in my last mini as well.
There is a slight scratch on the windshield that I didn't realize was a scratch till I tried to buff it out.
Piece of plastic moulding /trim on passenger door between windshield and passenger window near top of passenger window
When I enter and start the vehicle the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwheel√¢‚Ç¨¬ù icon spins for a while then fails to connect to my iPhone. Sometimes I have to try it 2 or 3 times
it's just noise that is common in a MINI.  When on the highway it is very noisy in the cabin which I am told is due to the sunroof/moonroof
: the illuminated lighting that is around the radio display sometimes does not display the color selected.  it will be part white part orange.
I don't use this option because it never seems to understand what I am saying and I speak perfect English
Front passenger door catches  a bit when opening/closing
Bad location  for certain controls / modes.

Wife has had problems connecting to bluetooth on her iPhone. Issue discovered recently.



Whe use USB audio, there's no explanation how to make playlist.I searchead internet to get an answer.
We miss prior Countryman model switch, which was separated 3 buttons, UP, FORWARD and DOWN.
When place bottle/cup in the holder, several latches installed inside the cup holder hole press the bottle/cup and some painted bottle got scratch on its side surface. I hope inside the cup holder hole have soft material on its surface.

I had the exact same problem with my previous Mini Cooper & was aware of it when I purchased this one.  Clearly it was not a deal breaker for me
Every time I have a passenger I have to buckle them in they can't find where to buckle it

Door panels are getting scuffed and even the Mini Cooper cleaner I bought is not removing it. It is from my tennis shoe when the wind was blowing and I braced the door so it wouldn't close. It left scuff marks. It was not excesssive force so I was surprised it left a mark
Black dust covering all four wheels
I've had satellite radio in a former car with very good reception with only minor poor reception in certain areas.  With the mini when I travel the same locations as my previous car I have more instances with no reception as with my previous car.
I just wish I would have gotten power operated seats.
I should have gotten power seats.
I don't like that it takes three manual controls before I can get the seat the way I'm comfortable driving the car.
I just seem to press what's just above the release before I press the release.  It's a two-step operation for me.
I answered this way, because it is the closest item to what I am actually encountering. I encountered this issue with both my 2015 and 2018 Mini Coopers.  Occasionally the seatbelt gets locked/twisted on itself and I have to hank it HARD to get it out to use it.
When accelerating from a stop, the engine does seem to stutter a few times before smoothing out.  I have noticed this a handful of times. It is not a consistent issue at this time.
Poor visibility when convertible top is open and this could be addressed or improved with raising height of interior center rear view mirror
Park assist is poorly explained and poorly documented. You tube video instruction would help but does not exist
Not easy to figure out all the controls for the seat adjustments.  Again, a design problem not a problem with the seat.
Design flaw.
Difficult to adjust seat headrests.
Very hard to reach front seat belts.  Back seat hard to find then buckle. Poor design rather then a problem with the seat belt.
I think it is a design fault that the trunk can be opened using the button on the remote but cannot be closed the same way
: Another design flaw, there is a built in wireless phone charger inside the center console which is not big enough to accommodate my Android  phone
car had scratch on front bumper which was tried to be concealed with touch up paint

It is just hard to know how to work the system and what to do when it fails. It is user error.

only soils because of light color.

: When listening to radio, there is a spontaneous split second pause/definite lower volume that occurs when driving. I was told it was blue tooth related, but this is when I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m listening to radio.
Takes a long time to cool car when it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hot

 : Occasionally
Traffic Patterns and not accurate. If the engineers could re program to sync with waze and use that live streaming information it would be wonderful.
Wife and others talk about difficulty in attaching seat belt.  Number 1 problem.
Unable to find password in material I have, cannot find in the system
Apple Carplay software disconnects frequently
It sounds like the noise comes from the housing for the rear sunroof shade. Adjusting the position of the shade will occasionally resolve the noise, but the noise occurs automaticall sporadically.
When roof is open wind noise seems high making difficult to hear radio, conversation.
Backup sensor could be louder.  Visual display is small.


Sometimes when It is raining, they do not come on. Other times when there is no water on the windshield, they do come on.
I have had the car for 3 and 1/2 months and I still can not figure out the radio/sattelite staions.  The navigation system categories/choices do not help find anything. I must have an actual address.

: While using the Bluetooth telephone feature, there is a LOUD cracking noise only heard within the car  at times.  Like an electrical crack.  Very loud.
Door releases based on foot motion but right cargo door does not swing open.
Dealer replaced air conditioning compressor and it stopped working again within 2 days. They found a faulty pressure valve and replaced. Seems to be working OK but not great.
: squeaky brake pedal 
radio has poor reception while driving in city and highways
seems to be constant however at times louder than others. : mistake in hitting meant to describe rattle in convertible top
Navagation across functions is baffling.  When I first got car it had display of a classic radio dial, but I haven't figured out how to get that display again.  Other functions are also obtuse.
Both driver & passengers have struggled with buckling up.  Buckle is hard to reach.
Sometimes there is a charge failure and the cause cannot be determined. : The vehicle loses its drive ready state if I take some time, for instance, entering an address into the navigation system. It then is not easy for me to figure out how to make it drive ready again.
My previous Mini did the same thing. It doesn't rattle all the time. I tap on it and it stops.
Steering wheel control is fine for volume adjustment and sometimes for station tuning, but the tuning function changes depending on where you are in the menu structure and that cannot be changed with the steering wheel controls. Menu structure is non-intuitive and really hard to memorize. In addition, the single control knob of the center console is in an inconvenient location.
AM radio reception is poor. This may be due to replacement of standard antenna with 'shorty' antenna.
While driving in 'normal' mode, the vehicle consumes half a tank of gas in 3 days after travelling 60 miles. Plan on on trying 'green' mode for the next couple of weeks in hopes of better fuel consumption.
When switching from low to high beams there was a 30 t0 50 feet in front of the vehicle that lacks brightness. within a week I took it in for a second delivery date that this dealership offers to its customers. they adjusted the hight of the high beams then. it is better but still lacks brightness when high beams are set.
see previous explanation.
When I stop to park the car the engine stops, but when I go to put it in park the engine starts again when it goes trough N or R and then again when the lever is in P. if I push the toggle switch before I put it in Park, then it gives me an error message

: Very easy to bump the gear shift LEFT into the Manual Shift notch unintentionally
Essentially the most significant problem I have is that my Sirius radio connection is frequently dropped . Also, people who call me on the phone while paired have difficulty hearing me.
You often have to wave your foot several times under the back end to engage the auto close/open
The seats are just not comfortable.
I mounted Weather Tech Window Guard on the front and back windows.
Still too new to have tried everything above.
Feature rarely works
Speed and clarity not the issue since i always give multiple attempts different ways until i give up and manually enter info
Unsure if an audio issue or nav issue but doesnt get destination info correct




Scratchy

Sometimes it doesn't recognize or misinterprets commands, but sometimes it is fine.
I've only had trouble a few times, where the vehicle didn't recognize my iPhone. Something else that happens frequently is that it will disconnect from the radio if a text comes in and then won't reconnect with the radio when the text messaging is finished.
Have to life center armrest to buckle
Difficult to use due to being blocked by cups in cup holder.
After taking the cover off to haul large items. I just assumed I had not replace the cover properly but have since attempted to fix it with out success.
It is a chip located right about the glass that I noticed the first time I washed my car.
It stumbles sometimes when the engine has shut off at a stop light and I step on the gas to move forward.
Not intuitive on how to get there
Not very intuitive

The clock is in two locations, but it is so small it is hard to see and find in either location.
the symbols for directional air is hard to understand.
Pandora tends to freeze since it wants to use the Mini BMW version of Pandora.
: when hitting bumps the hatchback seems to make noise.  As if it's not properly secured.  Also the shade that slides on the sunroof bounces around and makes noise as well.

It is difficult to enter the address quickly. It doesn't seem to recognize where I am, to further narrow down results. The Mini Connected navigation app is better, but you have to control it from your phone.
Sunroof screen rattles.
: XM Radio not working
: When making a phone call using bluetooth the display shown that it's dialing and then it hangs up before the call is connected.








steering wheel off by a quarter of an inch.
MUSTY SMELL COMING FROM A/C . DEALER REPLACE FILTER AND CLEAN EXITING EVAPORATOR. GREAT SERVICE AND VERY HAPPY WITH THE DEALER.
When plugged in, the  charging starts irrespective of the off-peak hours programmed.
Its a bit hard to understand what control adjusts the height.
: The plastic thing that's on the frame where the top part of the front passage door touches fell off
: windshield wipers squeak after a while




there's a peg that locks the mat in place but once I pulled it up to clean under the mat, now I can't seem to get it back on.  it moves and is kinda annoying

Estimated arrival time is usually very unrealistic at the beginning of the trip, even when traffic conditions are known. It has taken me on convoluted reroutes that add extra time. It is difficult to see the exact route you're agreeing.


The seats seem like they are heating up but then do not heat.
