If you compare the MB maps to Apple or Google Maps, you will see a drastic difference in color and ease of reading the map. Second, the routes it take you on are round-about and out of the way. I drive in the New York area and have had so many instances where the navigation system proposed a strange or indirect route. Third, it doesn't let you select the route you want as you can do if using your phone with Google or Apple maps. It should show you the route in an overview before executing it and give you a choice. Forth, the system talks too much!! It becomes annoying hearing it say too many commands, repeating over & over. I hate that MB forces you to choose between Apple Car Play and this more expensive system in the C class.  I should be able to have BOTH and would be easier with TOUCH SCREEN like GM has! : I don't like how the audio system operates with a Joy Stick.  The dealer did tell me that Touch Screens are not available in any Mercedes as they think if the driver is leaning over to touch it, the body is in an unsafe position.  I think that's ridiculous!  Almost every car in the US has a touch screen, including my other car, a 2017 Buick Envision.  The navigation system & Apple Car play in GM cars is MUCH better than Mercedes.
