This should not happen and there was no warning sound to tell us this.  Second problem is more significant. We park the car in a service garage; and one of the keys is left with the attendants. We called for the car one day; and when we got there it was running and waiting to drive. My husband drove it about 50 miles to do an errand. He parked the car and shut it off. He then realized he did not have HIS key on him. The attendant who started the car had the key. The car did not give any signal that a key was not in the car after my husband drove off with it.

The rattle only occurs when the vehicle has been sitting for a while.  If the vehicle has just been driven or doesn't sit for more than an hour or so; the rattle doesn't occur when the vehicle starts.  The dealership states that it is probably some part of the internal  ventilation system that is opening up and potentially getting caught or dragging on something.

In addition the Navigation system is highly confusing and difficult to use. When it does work it's wonderful; the Head Up display provides visual cues as to where to go; but getting it to work is often not worth the hassle. It's nearly impossible to use while the vehicle is moving; even using the voice controls and pretty much impossible to effect a manual input into the system as the wheel/dial device used for input is cumbersome and inaccurate.   It's often times much easier just to use Siri on my iPhone and allow it to guide me  than to use the in-car system.

So for instance if you wanted to play a song by Lil Wayne and you select that song using either the Head Up display or the dial; it will default to the first alphabetized song in your iphone that starts with the letter 'A'.

I am a radiologist who uses speech recognition software. I know what the Dragon engine is capable of and your system is 10 years behind the times. We don't use the voice command system because it is so bad and even though we love the car; we decided against purchasing a second BMW because of how bad the iDrive/voice command system it. You need touch screen controls like our old 2008 Acura TL. Surprisingly; it was a superior system. We'll go back to BMW if you fix iDrive and the incredibly bad voice recognition system. Also; I should be able to say 'Directions. Closest Ruth's Chris Steakhouse' and it should get me there. My phone can do that; why not my $74;000 car?

I have a 2008 Acura TL-S and it has a vastly superior touch screen navigation system. That's absurd. I had heard that iDrive was a problem; but I chose to ignore the critics and try it for myself. It's below average and that's being polite. I should be able to say 'Directions to Disney's Grand Floridian; Bay Lake Florida' and it should take me there. Instead; I have to google an address with my phone. Then; when I try to speak in the address with voice commands the BMW won't understand what I'm saying.

776,BMW,X5,7,Seats,M,When driver 1 and driver 2 enter the locked car; the car frequently fails to switch the memory seat to the driver's preferred setting. For example. Driver 1 parks the car. Turns off the engine. Locks the door. Later; Driver 2 uses comfort access to unlock the driver's door. Enters the car. The driver's seat will often NOT change it's adjustment to driver 2. Likewise; when you go to the settings menu and manually select the profile for driver 2 with the car running; but in park; the seat will NOT move to the correct position. So; after selecting profile 2 you have to manually hold the seat adjustment profile button on the side of the driver's seat to get the seat into the correct position. AND; you have to manually hold that button down until the seat has completely shifted into correct position. If you take your finger off the button before the transition is complete; the seat stops moving. ANNOYING.,-0.7717

778,BMW,X5,7,Interior,U,: There is a rotating hook on the driver's side of the cargo pay. It flips open and closed and is used to hook plastic grocery store bags to keep them upright and prevent cargo from moving around in the cargo area. This hook is located on the vertical wall of the cargo bay.  The first time I used it  it worked fine. However; when I tried to flip it back to a closed position; it would not return to its native position.  I placed my finger in the space to assess what was preventing it from properly closing and I realized that it is catching on a wiring harness.  I tried to push the harness back; but it is too stiff.  This is not something I would take the car to the dealer to repair; because I think they would do more harm than good and probably break something in the process.  After I finally got the hook to flip back in place; we decided to never use this hook feature again. Minor problem with a very easy solution.,0.5208

When staring at the map; sometimes it's hard to tell what street to turn on and whether or not it's the next street coming up. If on the detailed instruction sheet; we then can't see the map... Ideally if we need to make a turn coming up; the screen can split to show the written instruction  as well as the map itself on the other side of the screen. That would be much more helpful as sometimes I would miss a turn/exit if I wasn't sure if that was the street to turn on or the exit to take due to a long off ramp.  Thanks.,0.9028

1894,BMW,5 Series,5,Interior,D,Three complaints with the front cup holders.  It is directly in front of the temperature control buttons.  If you put anything other than a small take out cup in the front holders; you must reach around them to press climate control buttons.  And that goes for seeing the digital screen that displays the temperature etc. Then they are difficult to use. Beverage cups must be inserted into the hole at an angle. This creates spills. The buttons inside the hole seem to be square; making the cups very difficult to slide past and push them in.  The buttons on my last BMW were curved and therefore the cup slid right over them while they depressed into the holder.  Because they are a hard square plastic; putting a Styrofoam cup into the holder is dangerous.  These buttons push into the Styrofoam leaving an indentation along the way.  This happens every time the cup is taken in and out and leaves me worrying if the hard square plastic buttons are going to rip through my coffee cup.,-0.9337

1957,BMW,6 Series,2,Engine/Transmission,M,: The car completely stalled resulting in a loss of all controls. Steering and braking.

After almost a week of trying to diagnose the issue they said it was a result of water that was spilled in the trunk shorting out the electronics under trunk floor. The unit had to be replaced for over $1000.00 and was not covered under warranty. The floor of the trunk is easily removable made with what appears to be basically carpet covered cardboard. The engineering design that went into this system for a $120;000.00 CAR IS A JOKE. Not to mention an extreme liability potential for BMW.

BMW doesn't - at least not that I have noticed. This causes me confusion about the correct route when there are several potential streets close together.

3366,BMW,2 Series,3,Heating; Ventilation; and Air Conditioning (HVAC),D,: BMWs have central air vents that feature a hot/cold knob that can be adjusted independently of the driver and passenger vents.

3828,MINI,Cooper,4,Interior,D,I purchased the storage package option. With it comes an adjustable floor/lid for the rear storage compartment . I prefer to keep this 'cover' in the top most position; however; when it is opened its design is such that it slides down into the clips for the lower adjustment position. I suppose this is not mush of an issue for most however I have limited strength and function in my hands and trying to disengage that lid from those clips is a frustrating exercise. Having a clip mechanism for the lid in its upper position would be a huge convenience; from my perspective. I have not taken this to my dealer because it is a design issue.,0.0094
3829,MINI,Cooper,4,Engine/Transmission,D,Again; I am an unusual case and I am sure few people have this problem. As I mentioned earlier; my hands have limited strength and function. As a result; the location of the shifter lock button makes it imposable for me to depress it with a single hand. Because I also drive with hand-controls; I must hold the brake with my left hand and perform the shifting of the lever into drive with my right. I have taken a black plastic 'zip-tie' and fastened it around the shifter knob so as to permanently depress the shifter button.

This is because the first press will 'unlock' the already unlocked door; then the second or third press will eventually lock the door.   This is resolved if: 1.

3893,MINI,Cooper,3,Interior,M,My car is a hatchback.  We always have the rear seats folded forward and use the rear compartment for luggage; groceries; etc. The panel/cover that covers the 'lower storage compartment' tend to rattle and buzz -- nearly all of the time. I need to check it out further and probably will be able to solve the problem by wedging in a piece of foam or something on one or more of the edges of the vibrating panel/cover.,-0.4767
3894,MINI,Cooper,10,Exterior,M,: After rainy weather or wash car; then open windows and close them; there is significant streaks on the windows that are oily in nature.  I took to dealer and they replaced the rubber and brushes that guide the windows as they are opened/closed. Fixed now,0.128
3895,MINI,Cooper,10,Exterior,M,I had the exterior protection added at time of purchase. When they detailed the car they caused many  scratches across the back bumper.

3897,MINI,Cooper,10,Features/Controls/Displays (FCD),D,The head light and fog light controls are located in a very poor location.

3898,MINI,Cooper,10,Audio/Communication/Entertainment/Navigation (ACEN),D,: This refers to the bluetooth/usb integration with my iPhone using Mini Connected package. They claimed seamless integration. First; it has to be physically connected . They should be able to use a wireless bluetooth connection. When using bluetooth; there are many delays in recognizing the iPhone. Sometimes it takes 2-3 minutes before I can play music via bluetooth. Again; I upgraded to the better Mini Connected and many of the functions advertised like using the steering wheel controls to skip ahead in music and it follows along on the dash do not work with bluetooth. Can't even use the steering controls to skip ahead. I have to use the controls on the dash media player.,0.7783
3899,MINI,Cooper,10,Audio/Communication/Entertainment/Navigation (ACEN),D,First the nav system doesn't recognize when you use voice commands like 'map to 123 North Street in Folsom'. It rarely is able to get even close to the parts  Second; to manually enter an address; it takes several minutes to scroll around to spell out the pieces of the address.  Third; the nav system attempts to narrow selections down as you fill them in. However; there are many addresses that the nav system doesn't have; but could get close enough to work; but many times its hard to figure out what to pick to get you that close. I end up using my iPhone instead.,0.0387
3900,MINI,Cooper,10,Heating; Ventilation; and Air Conditioning (HVAC),D,Two issues: 1. My MINI has dual control. However; I drive mostly by myself . When I want to adjust the temp up or down; I end up changing both dials. They should have a 'sync' button like many other manufacturers so changing the driver side; changes both.  2. MINI cleverly has a in-dash vent. It operates with the vents that point at my face. I would like to be able to control whether that is on or off.,0.8225

3902,MINI,Cooper,10,Interior,D,MINI is a small car. I think more thought to having the best storage is mandatory. Its seems like an after thought. The glove box is small and shallow. When you open it during driving; things just fall out.,0.7906
3903,MINI,Cooper,10,Interior,D,I have MINI all weather  floor mats. For me; the goal of rubber mats is to be more durable; deal with wet; muddy situations. I had a previous MINI and had the same and the style and fit was great. They came up on the sides of the foot wells and trap all wet type stuff. My new MINI rubber mats are much different. They went for 'style' instead of function. They are flatter and have more decorative things. In turn; these don't trap the water/mud/stuff and keep on the mat.,0.6597
3904,MINI,Cooper,1,Features/Controls/Displays (FCD),M,: The rear sunroof shade rattles badly when retracted.  If the shade is closed; no issue.

Does not understand verbal directions and instead gives directions to address not requested.   This is a poorly designed system and nothing that a dealer can fix. It is the bad software design and not a mechanical issue. So it has not been taken to a dealer to fix.  : We have stopped using the navigation system because it is not intuitive in the least.,-0.7533

4138,MINI,Coupe/Roadster,3,Engine/Transmission,D,the engine is anemic...why even have a 'roadster' if a ford focus can beat it in traffic????  Very sharp design is ruined by poor hp engine.  Its a joke.  I sacrificed the looks a little and got a nisan 370z convertible that blows it off the rad but still looks sharp!  Same price too. : not enough power or acceleration due to very low hp.  The dealer cant fix a design flaw to the engine.

4139,MINI,Coupe/Roadster,3,Engine/Transmission,D,it is the engine design...the engineer should be shot!!!  The dealer re-calibrated it but it did not change anything.  a rock is a rock no matter how you dress it up.  the engine should have a hp of 300+.  Not 129 and 146!   Are you kidding me????  No wonder Consumer Reports does not consider it a 'roadster'.  It is a 'sporty car' but NOT a sports car and NOT a roadster.  sporty ONLY in looks.

4805,MINI,Countryman,2,Driving Experience,M,Two blow outs at 3600 miles and again at 4100miles.  Both caused by hitting chuckholes.  One on I 26 north of Columbia S.C. and the second on I 70 west of Columbus Ohio. First resulted in a tow to Mini dealer in Greenville S.C. 77 mile tow.  Had to have front realigned and was charged for the new tire even though had road hazard free replacement.  Their charge was $480 and we have not been reimbursed after request.  Pirelli said all Mini dealers are aware of the  warranty.  I beleive I have been defrauded.  The second blowout in Ohio resulted in a tow to Mid Western Mini and loss of car from Saturday until Tuesday.  They had no 19 inch tires in stock.  The service writer first told me I had no warranty as I had not bought the extended road hazard insurance. N8m I told her I had talked to Pirelli and that there was a year free replacment.  She said nothing further and when I picked up the car; I was not charged for the new tire just another 4 wheel alignment in less than one week.,-0.1779

4809,MINI,Countryman,6,Driving Experience,D,Hand brake is difficult to understand. When I think the brake is all the way down; it is not. It seems as though the handbrake has 2 stop positions making it annoying when the alert signal goes off. It also interferes with the center storage area where I like to place my phone while having it connected to USB or auxillary. Doesn't leave much room,0.165
4810,MINI,Countryman,6,Features/Controls/Displays (FCD),D,Need more lighting in trunk area! If trunk is full of cargo; light gets easily blocked making it very difficult to see anything.,-0.4186
4811,MINI,Countryman,6,Seats,D,Being only 5 feet tall; he headrest should come down further. I think the headrest should stop until it actually touches the seat instead of leaving a 1-2 inch gap,-0.296
4812,MINI,Countryman,6,Heating; Ventilation; and Air Conditioning (HVAC),D,When trying to defog/defrost in the morning; can take up to 5 minutes to defrost windshield. Very slow compared to previous cars driven. Also one time while raining; windshield and front windows fogged up so bad  nothing worked for me except to use the AC. It took  a lot of trial and error and was on a long commute home. Poverty inconvenient and dangerous while driving,-0.9432
4813,MINI,Countryman,6,Interior,D,I'm only 5feet tall; main sun visor and side sun visor are useless to someone of my stature. It doesn't cover the sun for me at all. It should be much longer,-0.4215

4815,MINI,Countryman,1,Interior,D,Cup holder is too close to the center dash panel; and larger cups won't sit up right. If you put a cup in them; it hits the dash and sit crooked. I often use the back seat cup holders due to this...however that makes it hard to get your drink while driving.,-0.1027
4816,MINI,Countryman,9,Exterior,D,headlines so faint I'm convinced they are not on at all.  Brights are barely enough; regular headlights useless. I plan to take it to dealer to have alignment checked but I've tried to check them myself and they seem okay.  There's a sort of shadow immediately in front of car extending out about 10 feet in front of car where there is no light on the road. The only way to tell they are on is to see if dials are lit up inside the car; because they barely shine enough when streetlights are on to see any difference on the road.,-0.0434
4817,MINI,Countryman,9,Features/Controls/Displays (FCD),D,Keyless entry functions properly about 80% of the time.  I can walk away from car for 10 minutes and when I return it won't work. Other times it works flawlessly for days.,0.2023
4818,MINI,Countryman,9,Audio/Communication/Entertainment/Navigation (ACEN),D,Because I bought GPS I was required to get armrest; but to connect iPhone required $250 snap-in adjustor. I complained so dealer gifted it. But it's out of date and can only sync with iPhone 5; so I have an old one there with no cellular; so cannot use MINI Connected features. Dealer provided cable to connect iPhone 6 to another port but it's in bad location in middle of rail; iPhone 6 flops around on seat or dangles near passenger leg. Whether connected via snap-in; cable; or bluetooth; connections are broken frequently for no reason ; sometimes works seamlessly for 10 or 15 times and then will disconnect every time the car is stopped.  Whether connected by cable or snap-in makes it hard to reach iPhone screen; so again I stick my phone on a $20 magnet attached to dash vent so I can ask Siri to play music or use my touchscreen. Audio system has funky buttons and joystick by parking break; NEEDS TOUCHSCREEN AND TO LAUNCH SIRI. Aux port in glove box doesn't do plybk,-0.9657
4819,MINI,Countryman,9,Audio/Communication/Entertainment/Navigation (ACEN),D,Needs to be touchscreen; NOT a joystick and pushbuttons under parking brake. cable connection leaves phone dangling in unsafe manner. snap-in adjustor only goes as high as iPhone 5; is expensive; needs constant adjustment . Needs to be able to launch Siri.,0.1779
4820,MINI,Countryman,9,Audio/Communication/Entertainment/Navigation (ACEN),D,voice commands must follow certain structure; which I can't seem to remember. Then I'm forced to use buttons and joystick to try to find entries in phone book; very slow. Instead I keep phone on dash and press home button and tell Siri to place the call or play music.,0.296
4821,MINI,Countryman,9,Audio/Communication/Entertainment/Navigation (ACEN),D,I hate the whole dang thing. Complicated; fussy; controls inconvenient; connection is broken 4 o4 5 times a day whether it's connected by bluetooth or cable or snap-in. I have to pop out old iPhone in snap-in connector constantly; because it frequently breaks the connection when the car is stopped. Other times is will stay connected for days. can't figure out what the trigger is.,-0.8779
4822,MINI,Countryman,9,Audio/Communication/Entertainment/Navigation (ACEN),D,I absolutely hate the in-car entertainment system. GPS maps features are ridiculously bad and out of date . Must use dials and buttons; not touch-screen. My 8-year old Garmin GPS has a better screen; fonts; maps views; information; usability.  MINI GPS takes too long to program; voice commands are restrictive; and it will not launch Siri on my iPhone.  I later bought a $20 magnet that connects to vent and now rely solely on my iPhone for GPS and so I can press the Home button to launch Siri. Have complained to dealer.,-0.7841
4823,MINI,Countryman,9,Seats,D,Headrest has no range of motion; and is tilted too far forward for me; and was causing neck pain.  so I had to remove it entirely to reverse it; so now the headrest points backward at the wrong angle and may not provide sufficient protection.,-0.8225

4826,MINI,Countryman,2,Audio/Communication/Entertainment/Navigation (ACEN),M,: The radio/nav system frequently reboots itself after being in use for 3-4 hours.  We had a Countryman replaced for the same reason.  We have not reported it this time as the radio was replaced in the first Countryman we owned four times and the problem continued.  I am assuming this is an ongoing problem with the countryman,-0.6597
4827,MINI,Countryman,5,Exterior,M,This occurred during the first few weeks of ownership- water was on the front right passengar floor mat.

I would rather have the large dial be my outside temperature.,0.0
