964,BMW,2 Series,3,,: I have two BMW vehicles. Each have the Harman Kardon audio and each cost $850 extra. The audio in my 2015 535D is superior in the audio features offered. Specifically the 'Logic 7' sound system advertised and promised on both models but not found on my M235. BMW has so far been unable to address this omission and explain why they charge the same price and advertise the including of the 'logic 7' but fail to provide it. This was advertised as part of the $850 Harmon Kardon option but has been removed. Plus the M235 uses 'Active Sound' to add fake exhaust sounds through the Harmon Kardon speakers. Why buy a premium sound system and then have fake exhaust sounds overpowering the music?
