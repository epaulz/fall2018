The key and it did not unlock the car doors. My husband opened up his key in order to access the actual key to physically open up the driver side door. The alarms went off immediately and we decided to try out the SOS feature in the car since this was technically an emergency where we would need assistance from BMW. This feature turned out to be totally useless; the operator came on and kept repeating options such as """"press 1 for... or press 2 for ..."""" The BMW does not have number choices so this was pointless. We eventually used our phones and had to call up BMW customer service. The person on the phone simply told us that since the keys did not unlock our car, this meant that the car battery must be dead.YouTube suggested holding up the key next to the key symbol by the steering wheel.",-0.7915
