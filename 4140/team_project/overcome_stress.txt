Took a short break and went back to working. 
Breathe, make tea
Tried to do the related work
Studying
watch tv, listen to music, or rest
Nothing 
I try to not think about the problem and clear my mind.
Communicated with my TA
I decided to get in contact with my classmate and have my classmate help me understand the concept. 
Working on the cause of stress 
Studied - forgot about it afterwards because there is nothing I can do about it now. 
Take it
Did the work
Tea
Ignored it
I turned it in on time.
Take 5 mins of break and think about it 
Taking a break every once in a while
Deep breaths to relax
I realized itâ€™s due next week. 
Netflix
I am mentally capable of pushing through the stress, but I plan on getting a lot of sleep to deal with it.
I am going to the lab later tonight to finish the lab.
Divert my mind for some time by watching tv and playing game.
Deep breaths, meditate, and lots of coffee
Went to the pool
Just sitting down and knocking out assignments
Walked faster 
I plan on making a plan to get them done. 
Procrastinating 
Breathe 
I went and got a Starbucks tea! 
I patiently waited for clas to end
Trying to prepare the best I can and reassuring myself that everything's going to work out
Gonna complete it before 5 
Got these errands done as early as possible.
